# Secret Angel flue grips Xebia India

We wanted to do something for Christmas and New Year and doing the same old things wasn’t motivating us. That’s where we were introduced to the idea of playing “Secret Angel”. It was 24th of December, and we started planning to get this idea floated among our fellow Xebians.

This game is all about keeping your “child” happy and surprised all through the duration that this game is played. So an Angel is identified (secretly) for an individual Child. Ideally, every angel picks a slip from the hat to find his child, however we customized it a bit, since we were doing it for the first time, so we (HR Team) shuffled the names and assigned a child to all the angels. The thumb rule was, all who volunteered to play became the default Angels. The surprise generally would be gifts, messages, poems and pranks among other things. 

Though we were not sure if people would really enjoy this game but it did take us by a surprise to see that all our fellow colleagues not only participated but went an extra mile to surprise the child. Everyone had only one question crossing their mind, who is my secret Angel, and how is he / she going to surprise me? The suspense kept on increasing as angels started surprising their respective child.

All kind of surprises hit the blocks, eatables were the most popular ones. Chocolates, Pastries, Brownies, and Fresh and hot “Maggie” topped the list.

The creativity of the Angels (our fellow colleagues) was visible through their gifts like a personalized coffee mug, photo frame, hand- made cards and t-shirts.

For those who were spectators to this game now started feeling left out and wanted to participate on the 2nd day of the game. Cafeteria talks were only around gifts and guesses. Some work areas were buzzing with ideas for creating some secret mission strategies for their child to find his surprise. People were really engrossed in the game now and were only waiting for getting to know who their secret Angel was. People were really feeling warm (especially in this chilly weather) and overwhelmed with the gestures shown by their fellow Xebians. Angels went on and found out likes and dislikes of their child to provide them with a suitable gift. One of the angels downloaded the photograph of the child from a social networking site and got it printed on a coffee mug.

As is rightly said “all good things come to an end” and so was true for this game as well, although we wanted to continue with the game but we had already decided on the last day of the game. We all gathered to adieu to 2010 and welcome 2011. Everyone was eagerly waiting to uncover the secret Angels. So we started with asking people to guess their Angels. Some of them did guess it right but some of us were totally taken by a surprise to know our Angels. Some of the “Child” had already planned for a surprise for their Angels and gave them return gifts when their name was revealed. The fun ended with cutting the cake and we relished the snacks served.![][1]

Personally, I really enjoyed this game. The thrill and the fun part of it were truly awesome. “Secret Angel” game was a big hit at Xebia as it was really engaging. The game brought people together to think and decide upon an appropriate gift for the child. It helped people to know each other better. Creativity and innovation were the main highlights of the game. The game created an atmosphere of joy, kindness and thankfulness which otherwise remains uncovered. 

We are all looking forward to many more activities and fun this year.

Wish you all a very Happy New Year 2011.
