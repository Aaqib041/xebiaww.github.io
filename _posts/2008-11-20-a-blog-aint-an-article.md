# A Blog aint An Article

<p>Recently I had an interesting discussion with a colleague about blogs and about what keeps people from posting a lot of them.
Especially in our fields where-in we learn something new every now and then and know that people will benefit from sharing our learning, what really pushes us away from blogging?
<!--more-->
One interesting point that came up in the discussion was that may be people wait till “they are there”… till they are “9 on 10” on a topic, till they know-it-all!
May be they are confused if it’s good enough?</p>
<p>Well this is exactly what a blog is meant to be – a quick capture of an interesting learning that you feel would be a nice-to-share.
<strong>A blog is NOT an article.</strong> For sure we expect an article to be formal, well crafted, we expect the author to be really well versed. But the blog surely doesn’t need to be an expert’s advise. If I am novice in a technology and after a great effort was able to learn how to avoid a trivial pitfall it may well be a big time-saver for another novice. For sure it won’t help an expert in the field, but it is not even meant to do that. An expert isn’t the targeted audience at all.</p>
<p>I felt may be this is a trivial discussion, but then realized that if this was interesting to me, may be its interesting to so many potential bloggers out there….</p>
<p>Friends, I am waiting to read all those blogs, all the pitfalls I can avoid, and all the invaluable experiences that you had, so blog-on!</p>
