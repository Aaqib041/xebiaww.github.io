We have been exploring Atlassian tools and in this blog we want to share our knowledge and experience with these tools. It would be difficult to capture each tool in detail in one blog. That is why in this blog we will cover

          Brief detail of each tool

          Key features and advantages

In our subsequent blogs we will discuss each tool in more detail and see how they help do agile better. 

 

Following tools are provided by Atlassian:

  1.  Confluence 2. JIRA 3\. FishEye 4\. Crucible 5\. Bamboo 6\. Clover 7\. Crowd

Confluence is a very powerful collaboration tool. Confluence combines powerful online authoring capabilities, deep Office integration and an extensive plugin catalog to help people work better together and share information effortlessly. Which means that Confluence goes beyond the sharing platform definition and through macros integrates with all the office tools like Ms-Office or Open Office to leverage the capabilities of these tools and make confluence more powerful. Confluence can take RSS feed to consume content from external source (like JIRA) and act as single dashboard/interface for for all sorts of  critical information. Confluence is ideal for managing project artifacts, posting announcements and facilitating discussions. 

Key advantages of using Confluence are:

  * Extremely simplifies the procedure of posting relevant content online, initiate a discussion, make announcements etc.

  * Acts as a central repository for information and hence reduces the risk of delivering stale data.

  * Confluence can be used as the central location to manage all information related to a project so that the updated information is always available to all stake holders.

  *  Confluence can help monitor the status of a project. Confluence can integrate with JIRA and display all relevant and critical information related to bugs.

  * Confluence (2.10 onwards) comes bundled with macros which helps view and edit office documents on confluence.

  * Confluence is highly extensible and configurable which helps customize confluence for custom needs easily.

  * Access to all the content on confluence can be controlled via the mature authentication and authorization capabilities of confluence.  

  *  All pages and page hierarchy on confluence can be exported to XML, HTML, PDF format.

**JIRA **- is an efficient bug tracking and project management tool. If there is an activity which is to be taken up by a team, has a workflow and needs to be tracked then JIRA can be a good tool for managing such an activity. JIRA can add other good to have features like automatic notifications, watcher lists etc. JIRA is highly customizable through configuration and easily extensible using plugins which makes it all the more powerfull to suit all custom needs of project and issue management. 

  * Once customized it becomes very easy to create bugs from a browser, email, even IDE and smart phones.

  * JIRA provides the capability of linking dependent issues, marking the issues as duplicate against some already existing issue, making some subtasks etc, which helps organize the issues much better. 

  * JIRA is an extensible platform that can be customised to match to custom business processes.

  * JIRA can be used for Project Management through tracking, allocation and reporting on project tasks with real- time statistics.
