# Insight of Scrum Master’s role

Who is Scrum Master? What are roles and responsibilities of Scrum Master?  These points are well written in many books and scrum guide. Many a times while doing coaching and talking to different people I realized, people get confused with some areas related to Scrum Master’s role. No one can become Scrum Master in a day or by attending few hours of training. Training is the beginning of a journey in agile world. To be a good scrum master, remember the principle of **“inspect and adapt”**. There is no ground rule. One solution could work for one team and could fail for the other. So first try to understand the problem and then try out some solution. If it doesn’t work then try something else. This is the key behavior of scrum master. Here in this article I am going to focus on some areas as per my experience. 

  * Is Scrum Master a management role?
  * Scrum Master is a leader or not?
  * Can Scrum Master and Product Owner be the same Person?
  * Is Scrum Master a full time role?
  * Should Scrum Master be collocated with the team?
**_“A leader is best when people barely know he exists, when his work is done, his aim fulfilled, they will say: we did it ourselves. “ – Lao Tzu_** **_ _**We know very well that a SM is a servant leader. Servant leadership model is as follows : ** ![servant](/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/servant.jpg)** ** **

  * Is Scrum Master a management role?
  * Scrum Master is a leader or not?
Keeping this model in mind, yes scrum master is a leader and it is a management position. He manages the team without authority, only by serving them. Scum Master is more of a role rather than a position. 
  * Can Scrum Master and Product Owner be the same Person?
If scrum master role and product ownership is handled by same person then there will be conflict of interest. Product Owner is a business person and scrum master is related to process and people. Consider one simple scenario when Product Owner wants her team to deliver more and scrum master has to protect the team if expected work is not as per team’s capacity. In this scenario Scum Master and Product owner convince each other and negotiate as per team’s comfort level. If SM and PO is same person, then will be no one with the team to protect. 
  * Is Scrum Master a full time role?
Qualities of Scrum Master – A good listener A good observer If scrum master doesn’t perform her role full time then she will not get chance to observe the team. To remove impediments as and when reported. She won’t be able to inspect and adapt. If team is mature enough and self-organized, then full time may not be a requirement. 
  * Should Scrum Master be collocated with the team?
Yes, always… To communicate better with the team. To make the team frank enough so that they can ask any question and report the problems. **_“ The basics of being a ScrumMaster are fairly straightforward: At face value all a ScrumMaster needs to do is facilitate the Scrum process and remove impediments. But being a great ScrumMaster, one who truly embodies the principles of servant-leadership and helps move a team to the high performance levels possible with Scrum, is much harder and much more elusive.” _** **_ _**-       **_Scrum Mastery: From Good To Great Servant-Leadership by Geoff Watts_** For more details on Xebia's offerings on Agile Consulting, [Click here](http://www.xebia.in/agile-consulting.html)
