# Great Indian Developers Summit Banglore 2010

For few years now [GIDS][1] , Banglore has been a huge gathering  for IT professionals in India where many enthusiastic presenters from across the globe present and talk about the latest and greatest in the world of Technology. This year it is even better with some great sessions on Web 2.0, RIA, Java/J2EE from some super individuals. Xebia India also participated in this year's event. Let me share some new ideas that were show cased.

**The conference**

To explain briefly what GIDS offers, there are sessions on .NET, Web 2.0, Java from April 20-23. There were some well known speakers like Marty Hall, Venkat Subramaniam, Khurram Khan, Matthew McCullough etc. As usual there were huge number of attendees from across India and especially from Banglore. The sessions were on latest hot topics like Cloud computing, Rich internet applications using Ajax, building iPhone applications, monetizing your applications by using PayPal, effective java, java and groovy generics and so on.  **Highlights**

[Matthew McCullough][2] , energetic is the word to describe him. He is NFJS(No fluff just stuff) speaker. His sessions were purely technical and were excellent. He talked about Open source web debugging tools which really helps a java developer like tcpdump, wire shark, netstat, curl, Jmeter, Soap Ui, Firebug, Firefinder, MODI, Fire Focus, JASH. One must have to learn about these tools to be a efficient developer.

Hadoop- Divide and Conquer, Matthew encouraged and convinced audience that we will be moving to building software that uses distributed resources very shortly and he talked about how Apache Hadoop framework can be used to build applications that uses these kind of resources.

Matthew also gave glimpses about **Maven 3 **and how is it going to be better than maven2 in terms of performance, color highlighting help of errors and info messages, polu glot maven and its multi language support and how it is better with respect to validations, performance.

Last but not least from him, building iPhone applications using objective C for Java developers. This was great introduction talk and really was a great encouraging talk for developers to delve into learning to build iPhone apps. He built a sample application for us and deployed that on to his own iPhone. He also held a work shop on Google App engine. All in all, the sessions by Matthew were absolutely brilliant and though provoking.

Khurram khan from PayPal talked about how PayPal integration in to our applications and different ways of payment that can be achieved. He encouraged young developers to **monetize their applications by integrating with PayPal**.  There is even a marriage of Mobile applications and PayPal. I though it was very easy to integrate and use and test PayPal transactions. I could easily integrate PayPal in my grails application.

[Venkat subramaniam][3], the famous agile and java guru also conducted his sessions on various topics. He talked about the design patterns in Java and Groovy, how to effectively use Java, Goog,bad and ugly of Java generics. As usual the sessions by Venkat are great and very informative.

**Trends** The following are some trends that are currently the buzz words and are fast growing  in the world of technology 

  * Cloud computing
  * iPhone Applications
  * Monetizing the applications(mobile also) using PayPal
**Conclusion** **GIDS ** is always a great conference to catch up with the latest and greatest in Java technologies and also to have new ideas as a Java developer. GIDS provides the ocassion for it along with some good old  material  to improve Java basics.
