<p><strong>Managing Agile Organizations- A Perspective from the Executive Management</strong>
By adopting a mindset of continuous renewal, an organization helps to create a culture that supports and motivates the kinds of behaviours required to be more agile. The issue of agility also relentlessly forces executives to look at their companies' ability to execute, not just to strategize. The agile organizations put its "non-negotiables", in the centre, while empowering the local units and geographies to be more responsive and adaptive to local markets, customers and trends. This creates the right mix of operating model with the nimbleness and speed of frontline innovators. Keeping this in mind, this session would elucidate upon the various subtleties of managing an agile organisation.</p>

<p><strong>The Servant Leader</strong>
Modern teams require modern management. Current methodologies recommend a leader that serves the team - as opposed to a team that serves the leader. Modern teams require a leader to show the way and to clear the path of obstacles. Modern teams do not need someone telling them what to do and hardly even when to do it. Modern teams are self-organising, comprised of individuals with power, drive and expert knowledge.  Outlining the changing role of a leader in modern teams, this session will speak of the idea of the Servant Leader, and all that it encompasses.</p>

<p><strong>Agility for Business Leaders : In it to Win it</strong>
"Is Agility only for teams, or do business leaders need to change their ways too?” Agility has long been perceived to be the domain of engineers. Engineering practices, Scrum Ceremonies, User stories all focus on how the team uses the concepts of agility to deliver the best possible value for clients. But the business leaders’ involvement, encouragement and key decisions are quintessential for the teams to imbibe true principles of agility. This talk focuses on the need for business to get involved, the skillsets required from the business leaders in an agile environment, key drivers to measure the effectiveness of agile methods and how the transformation can be made smooth. The audience will be taken through set of activities and situational questions to discuss and imbibe the concepts.</p>
