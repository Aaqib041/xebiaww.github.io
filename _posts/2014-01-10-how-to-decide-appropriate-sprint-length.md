# How to decide appropriate sprint length ??

<p>When a team begins a project using scrum, one of the important question that arises is what should be the sprint length? As per scrum recommendations length should be in between <strong>1 to 4 week</strong>. But what is appropriate for my project, which we need to decide.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="http://cdn.blog.3back.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/time-box-scrum.jpg" /></p>
<p><strong style="line-height: 1.5em">Factors influencing sprint length</strong><strong style="line-height: 1.5em">:</strong></p>
<p>1) Type of work</p>
<p>2) Team maturity</p>
<p>3) Team's comfort</p>
<p>Apart from the reasoning of team maturity and type of work, there is one more factor of human nature. If we use sprint length of 1 week, team members feel pressure.</p>
<p><strong>1 week sprint:</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>For 1 week sprint duration i.e 7 days team gets only 4 days to work because of sprint planning, review and retrospective. Some
teams argue that they don’t get time for innovation, delivery better quality product and avoiding risks of unplanned leaves. So the motivation gets down. For this team should be very mature enough. Work can be devided to accommodate within 1 week.</p>
<p><strong>Longer sprints:</strong>
In research type of work where we can't accommodate work  in short sprints, we can go for longer sprints.</p>
<p>If we are going for longer sprint durations, one aspect of human nature is for people to postpone and procrastinate on work that they know they need to do. We can also call it ―"college term paper thinking". Again decrease in motivation.</p>
<p>Also we are taking more risk by handling it on monthly basis. We also push retrospectives to happen once in a month which is not good for team.</p>
<p>As per <strong>agile manifesto</strong>: “<em><strong>Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, </strong></em><em><strong>developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely</strong>.</em>”</p>
<p>So to work in constant pace we should get rid of procrastination behaviour and that’s not possible so play with it.</p>
<p><strong>2 weeks' sprint cycle</strong>:</p>
<p>The best sprint length is of 15 days as suggested by everyone but it depends on team synergy, motivation and maturity.</p>
<p>So there is no ground rule, we need to first observe these factors to include in the decision making corresponding to sprint length.</p>
<p>Utilizing iterations also helps combat two very common and human conditions, often referred to as: "<em><strong>The Student Syndrome" </strong></em>and<strong> "</strong><em><strong>Parkinson’s Law"</strong></em>.</p>
<p>The <strong>Student Syndrome</strong> refers to school students that wait until the very last minute to start their project assignments.</p>
<p><strong>Parkinson’s Law</strong> refers to the occurrence whereby work assigned to teams —regardless of how simple— expands to fill the
allotted time. Shorter iterations help combat both of these conditions and the associated risk and waste.</p>

<p>As per current trends most of the projects use 2 weeks' sprint cycle.</p>
