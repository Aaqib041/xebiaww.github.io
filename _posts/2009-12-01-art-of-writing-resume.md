# Art of Writing Resume

<p>Resume is generally the corporate identity for any individual. In professional life, this is the first thing shared with anyone. Psychiatrists can even guess the personality of a person by looking at the resume. It is the first impression of you to any stakeholder who wants to engage you. Besides, resume also represents our written communication skills and presentation skills.</p>
<p>While making any professional document, it is very important to know the target audience. For resume – anyone from any background can be the audience. In fact, language of the resume should be written in such a manner that any kind of audience can easily understand. Another attribute of resume is that it should be able to generate interest in the reader and the interest must continue till the end. Here are few tips that might help:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Short and simple sentences.</li>
    <li>Avoid abbreviations. If required, use extension at least first      time.</li>
    <li>Nouns should be used as it is. (e.g. J<strong>U</strong>nit, J<strong>B</strong>oss, Web<strong>L</strong>ogic).</li>
    <li>Same tense (past or present) throughout the document.</li>
    <li>Avoid repetition of phrases.</li>
    <li>Be explicit wherever possible. Write objectively. Avoid ambiguous      words like etc., many, approximate. Idea here is – if you don’t know precisely      about yourself – who else would know?</li>
    <li>Consistency in font, style is very important.</li>
    <li>Avoid local references. Resume generally goes to international      customers. For them any local reference (name of local university) has no      meaning unless it is a well known thing (e.g. IIT, IIM etc.).</li>
    <li>Avoid highlighting (using bold) text unless it is of really significant      importance.</li>
    <li>Grammatically correct. (e.g. no uppercase letter in between a      sentence, full stop at the end      etc.)</li>
    <li>Avoid using copy paste from other person’s resume.</li>
    <li>If you have written any article or blog, it is good to give      URL(s).</li>
    <li>Header and footer should appear on every page and must be consistent      in font.</li>
    <li>Project description should be simple and concise so that it is      easy to understand by anyone and generates interest.</li>
    <li>After finishing the resume, take a print out and verify if      everything is in right format, no truncation.</li>
    <li>The project history should be in reverse chronological order.</li>
</ul>

<p>Although <a href="http://www.visualcv.com/www/quickstart/" target="_blank">Visual CVs</a> and <a href="http://web.me.com/agueniot/alstudio/cv/en.htm" target="_blank">musical CVs</a> are also getting popular these days and would probably be next level of innovation thereby harnessing the true power of IT. But the need of a well documented and structured resume would always remain. There is no alternate to this.</p>
