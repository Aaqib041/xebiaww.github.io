# Orchestrating JBoss Services from Intalio business processes (Part-1)

In this video series, we are going to learn how to orchestrate jboss services from within Intalio BPM processes.

The video explains we start with first creating our service in JBoss ESB and then publish this as a web service. We will also show you how you can test such a service using Soap UI.In the next video, we will show you how you can create a business process inside Intalio business Process Modeler and call the service created in Part-1 from within that process.
