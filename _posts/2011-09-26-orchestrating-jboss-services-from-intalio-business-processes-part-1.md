# Orchestrating JBoss Services from Intalio business processes (Part-1)

<p>In this video series, we are going to learn how to orchestrate jboss services from within Intalio BPM processes.</p>
<p>The video explains we start with first creating our service in JBoss ESB and then publish this as a web service. We will also show you how you can test such a service using Soap UI.In the next video, we will show you how you can create a business process inside Intalio business Process Modeler and call the service created in Part-1 from within that process.
