# Import and run a GWT (Maven) project in Eclipse

<p>In my current project the UI is developed using GWT framework. So the UI maven project is a GWT project and the rest of the projects are core java, which cater to the server side code. New developers who join the project struggle initially to setup the GWT project to run in the Dev Mode. We had similar problems in my earlier project also, which suggests that importing and running an existing GWT (maven) project is not as straight forward as creating a new GWT project and running it in Dev mode. Through this blog, I will try to document the procedure to import and setup an existing GWT project to run/debug in the Dev mode.</p>
<p>Our UI project consists of many smaller GWT Modules, which adds to the complexity of the setup and considerably increases the build time. The current build time for the UI is 40mins. To reduce this we have created duplicate module XMLs (&lt;project-name&gt;Local.gwt.xml) in parallel to actual XMLs. For example, for ABC module, we have ABC.gwt.xml and ABCLocal.gwt.xml. Both XMLs build the same project but the <em>Local.gwt.xml builds it for Mozilla with English locale only. This reduces the build time to ~5mins. We use the build generated by </em>Local.gwt.xml for development purpose.

I have mentioned below the procedure that I usually follow to setup the project and it has always worked for me.
<h5><span style="line-height: 14px;">Install the GWT plugin in Eclipse.</span></h5>
The simplest way to install the plugin is to use the Update site. I have mentioned the update sites for Eclipse Juno and Indigo.</p>
<p>Eclipse 3.8/4.2 (Juno): http://dl.google.com/eclipse/plugin/4.2
Eclipse 3.7 (Indigo): http://dl.google.com/eclipse/plugin/3.7
<h5>Import the Maven project</h5>
Import the project in Eclipse like any other Maven project. Nothing special needs to be done for the GWT projects.
<h5>Set the properties</h5>
Once the project is imported, right click on the project and select "Properties". A window like the one shown below will pop-up. The GWT Plugin is already installed in Eclipse, so open the "Google" menu item and click on "Web Application".</p>
<p><a href="http://xebee.xebia.in/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Screenshot-from-2013-06-16-110001.png"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-16754" alt="Screenshot from 2013-06-16 11:00:01" src="http://xebee.xebia.in/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Screenshot-from-2013-06-16-110001-300x211.png" width="300" height="211" /></a></p>
<p>Select the check box for "This project has a WAS directory" and select the WAR directory. It will typically be "src/main/webapp". Do not select the check box for "Launch and deploy from this directory".</p>
<p>Now click on the "Web Toolkit" menu item and select the check box for "Use Google Web Toolkit". Next select the GWT SDK. You can choose one from the maven repository or configure a specific SDK. When importing an existing project, there will be some version of the SDK already downloaded in the maven repository, so usually it is best to go with that version.</p>
<p><a href="http://xebee.xebia.in/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Screenshot-from-2013-06-16-110444.png"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-16755" alt="Screenshot from 2013-06-16 11:04:44" src="http://xebee.xebia.in/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Screenshot-from-2013-06-16-110444-300x211.png" width="300" height="211" /></a></p>
<p>Once the SDK is selected, Add all the GWT modules using the "Add" button on the same pop-up window. Make sure all the Module XMLs get added here. In case, your project also has a *Local.gwt.xml or similar Modules for faster builds, it is better to add those XMLs here instead of the actual Module XMLs. This will reduce the GWT compile time in Eclipse. If there are 10 modules in your project, which have EntryPoint, this screen should have all the 10 Module XMLs added.
<h5>Compile the project</h5>
Once the project properties are set, right-click on the project again and go to the "Google" &gt; "GWT Compile" menu item. This will open up a pop-up window shown below.</p>
<p><a href="http://xebee.xebia.in/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Screenshot-from-2013-06-16-111612.png"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-16757" alt="Screenshot from 2013-06-16 11:16:12" src="http://xebee.xebia.in/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Screenshot-from-2013-06-16-111612-300x244.png" width="300" height="244" /></a></p>
<p>In the "Entry Point Module" section, click on the "Add" button and add all the Module XMLs here. As mentioned earlier, select all the module XMLs. Include the full build XMLs or the development build XMLs. It is better to select the development build XMLs to reduce the compile time and help faster development.</p>
<p>Once all the modules are added the "Compile" button is enabled. Click on the button to compile the project.
<h5>Run in Dev Mode</h5>
The project is now imported, compiled and ready to run. Click on the project and select the "Run" &gt; "Run Configurations..." from the top Menu bar. It will open up a pop-up shown below. Select the "Web Application" from the list on the left and click on the "New" button to create a new configuration for the project.</p>
<p><a href="http://xebee.xebia.in/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Screenshot-from-2013-06-16-123639.png"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-16760" alt="Screenshot from 2013-06-16 12:36:39" src="http://xebee.xebia.in/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Screenshot-from-2013-06-16-123639-300x178.png" width="300" height="178" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://xebee.xebia.in/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Screenshot-from-2013-06-16-123721.png"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-16761" alt="Screenshot from 2013-06-16 12:37:21" src="http://xebee.xebia.in/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Screenshot-from-2013-06-16-123721-300x178.png" width="300" height="178" /></a></p>
<p>Couple of things that need to be configured in the "Run Configuration".
<ul>
    <li><span style="line-height: 14px;">(Optional) Rename the configuration from "New_configuration" to the project name</span></li>
    <li>Make sure the "Main Class:" text box has "com.google.gwt.dev.DevMode"</li>
    <li>Select the "GWT" tab and ensure that all the project modules are listed, otherwise "Add" the modules</li>
    <li>Select the "Arguments" tab and check the "Program arguments". This will get populated automatically. Check that "-war" is added to the arguments. This argument should point to the webapp directory. For example, "-war /home/anand/trunk/ui/src/main/webapp"</li>
    <li>For better performance, use the "VM arguments" section and add the "-Xmx1024m" parameter. Increase/decrease the memory according to the project requirements.</li>
    <li>Click on "Apply" and "Run"</li>
</ul>
The "Development Mode" view should give the URL once the application is started. The link would look something like this "http://127.0.0.1:8888/index.html?gwt.codesvr=127.0.0.1:9997". Double clicking the link would open it up in the default browser. The application should be running in Dev mode now. Same configuration can be used to debug the application. Add the breakpoints and start debugging...</p>
<p>If you have managed to follow the blog till this point, then you just lost an excuse for not picking up the UI stories from the board from now on.</p>
