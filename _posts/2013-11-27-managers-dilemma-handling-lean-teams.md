# Manager’s Dilemma: Handling Lean Teams

<p>In most start up and smaller companies with less than 200 employees the managers expectations are very simple-  to get the most out of teams.</p>
<p>The manager given the current market craze is happy to follow Kanban and considers it’s a silver bullet.</p>
<p>In trying to get most out of every team, the manager’s objectives are:
<ul>
    <li>Pushing out features</li>
    <li>Make his/her teams work transparent to higher management</li>
    <li>More productivity from teams</li>
    <li>Reach his/her quarterly goal<img class="size-medium wp-image-17657 alignright" alt="Schneider-Culture-Model" src="http://xebee.xebia.in/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Schneider-Culture-Model-300x219.jpg" width="300" height="219" /></li>
    <li>Be in charge and have the authority</li>
    <li>Make quick decisions to save time for the team t keep them more productive</li>
</ul>
The team members on the other hand want:
<ul>
    <li>Good work environment</li>
    <li>Good salary/hike/reviews</li>
    <li>Work as part of a good team</li>
    <li>Build resume</li>
    <li>Be part of winning team</li>
    <li>To be recognized</li>
</ul>
Now if you compare, objectives for both parties rarely meet to make their objectives into a common goal.</p>
<p>A manager considers the visual Kanban board as the only lean mechanism where the rest can be managed by him</p>
<p>/her for the betterment of the team. At least that’s what he/she thinks.</p>
<p>What is forgotten is to keep team members motivated, the new age theory of “Self Determination” should be considered.</p>
<p>This theory focusses on three things:
<ul>
    <li>Competence</li>
    <li>Autonomy</li>
    <li>Relatedness</li>
</ul>
If you consider from the Kanban perspective- teams pull in stories based on their competence, work is based on pull system which gives you the autonomy and by working as part of a team you can still be related in your workplace.</p>
<p>It should be pretty easy to keep team members motivated.</p>
<p>However, as they say: <b><i>A single cockroach will completely wreck the appeal of bowl of cherries b</i></b></p>
<p><b><i>ut a cherry will do nothing at all for a bowl of cockroaches - Rozin</i></b></p>
<p>So, at the end of the day getting the right team culture is very important for the manager as well. Becau</p>
<p>se if you are more into the <b>Cultivation</b> and <b>Collaboration</b> side of quadrant (based on Schneider’s  Model of Culture) chances are team will be much more lean than cultivating into the <b>Control </b>side of things.</p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5em">So, what can a manager do:</span>Now the only reason most managers get into the control mode is because they want to stop reworking and the wastage that comes with it. I think the thought to consider here is that it’s not a wastage if you are giving the time to the team to figure out a problem and collaborate and come together to resolve the issue. This leads to a lot of time being saved later. A short term solution doesn't help the bigger picture.
<ul>
    <li>Dissect roles and responsibilities- Ensure that roles are not overlapped. In situations where one person plays the role of a PO, Functional Manager and domain expert chances are things will be messier.</li>
    <li>Keep the work ready in a Pull State- Provide enough information so the team doesn’t have to run to you every second to clarify. You don’t need to re-affirm your authority by not allowing teams to work.</li>
    <li>The 10,000 hour rule- Allow the time to the team to work and improve, things don’t improve overnight.</li>
    <li>Identify blockers- Look into the impediments and then see how the team is resolving them or what can be learned that as a manager you can help the team do better at. May be resolve inter team dependency.</li>
    <li>Know the luggage you are carrying- Make sure the luggage is visible to you and you can track it. Don’t keep risk items out of sight ever.</li>
    <li>Encourage value creation- Against just delivering stories that will end up in rework.</li>
    <li>Find Gaps- Use value map streaming to understand the lags and in trying to resolve those time lags will lead to saving time and in return money for the organization.</li>
</ul>
The bottom line is in trying to resolve things and make the team more productive, you shouldn’t turn into a blocker yourself.</p>
