# Manager’s Dilemma: Handling Lean Teams

In most start up and smaller companies with less than 200 employees the managers expectations are very simple-  to get the most out of teams.

The manager given the current market craze is happy to follow Kanban and considers it’s a silver bullet.

In trying to get most out of every team, the manager’s objectives are: 

  * Pushing out features
  * Make his/her teams work transparent to higher management
  * More productivity from teams
  * Reach his/her quarterly goal![Schneider-Culture-Model][1]
  * Be in charge and have the authority
  * Make quick decisions to save time for the team t keep them more productive
The team members on the other hand want: 
  * Good work environment
  * Good salary/hike/reviews
  * Work as part of a good team
  * Build resume
  * Be part of winning team
  * To be recognized
Now if you compare, objectives for both parties rarely meet to make their objectives into a common goal.

A manager considers the visual Kanban board as the only lean mechanism where the rest can be managed by him

/her for the betterment of the team. At least that’s what he/she thinks.

What is forgotten is to keep team members motivated, the new age theory of “Self Determination” should be considered.

This theory focusses on three things: 

  * Competence
  * Autonomy
  * Relatedness
If you consider from the Kanban perspective- teams pull in stories based on their competence, work is based on pull system which gives you the autonomy and by working as part of a team you can still be related in your workplace.

It should be pretty easy to keep team members motivated.

However, as they say: **_A single cockroach will completely wreck the appeal of bowl of cherries b_**

**_ut a cherry will do nothing at all for a bowl of cockroaches - Rozin_**

So, at the end of the day getting the right team culture is very important for the manager as well. Becau

se if you are more into the **Cultivation** and **Collaboration** side of quadrant (based on Schneider’s  Model of Culture) chances are team will be much more lean than cultivating into the **Control **side of things.

So, what can a manager do:Now the only reason most managers get into the control mode is because they want to stop reworking and the wastage that comes with it. I think the thought to consider here is that it’s not a wastage if you are giving the time to the team to figure out a problem and collaborate and come together to resolve the issue. This leads to a lot of time being saved later. A short term solution doesn't help the bigger picture. 

  * Dissect roles and responsibilities- Ensure that roles are not overlapped. In situations where one person plays the role of a PO, Functional Manager and domain expert chances are things will be messier.
  * Keep the work ready in a Pull State- Provide enough information so the team doesn’t have to run to you every second to clarify. You don’t need to re-affirm your authority by not allowing teams to work.
  * The 10,000 hour rule- Allow the time to the team to work and improve, things don’t improve overnight.
  * Identify blockers- Look into the impediments and then see how the team is resolving them or what can be learned that as a manager you can help the team do better at. May be resolve inter team dependency.
  * Know the luggage you are carrying- Make sure the luggage is visible to you and you can track it. Don’t keep risk items out of sight ever.
  * Encourage value creation- Against just delivering stories that will end up in rework.
  * Find Gaps- Use value map streaming to understand the lags and in trying to resolve those time lags will lead to saving time and in return money for the organization.
The bottom line is in trying to resolve things and make the team more productive, you shouldn’t turn into a blocker yourself.
