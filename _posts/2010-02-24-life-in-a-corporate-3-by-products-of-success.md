# Life in a Corporate -3 By Products of Success 

<p>I have realized over the period of time that in general, most of the employees when they join a new company are very humble, obedient, polite, and team player. It appears that they want to learn from everyone. Relationships with colleagues are at its best till then. As they start becoming successful which is obviously a result of entire team’s good work - they tend to forget who helped them in their journey of success. This transition of behavior is largely due to feeling of insecurity early on due to which they don’t want to disobey or disappoint anyone. But gradually with success, they start feeling more secure and established so they feel they don’t need anyone.</p>
<p>Success goes into head. Same people who they have learnt from, who they followed religiously, who helped them integrating into company culture – they start ignoring and disrespecting the same people around. In the pursuit of success, ‘I am someone’ feeling takes precedence.</p>
<p>Like beauty is short-lived, feeling proud is also short-lived. <!--more-->There is a thin line between being proud and being arrogant. Loaded with laurels, they never know when they have crossed this line. Even worse it, on being reminded about the same – they take it negatively because now sitting comfortably; they think they don’t need anyone.</p>
<p>They start taking decision in isolation based on their whims and fancy ignoring every other stakeholder and colleagues (except the manager who is responsible for appraisal). To consolidate the success further, political nature starts showing its colors, attributes like bypassing others, back-biting starts appearing. This is the beginning of entering the dragon of corporate evils. This is where relationship starts becoming sour. Once the relation is broken, it can never go back to original pious state. Managing corporate relationship is not an easy thing. Success of a task is transactional and short-lived but relationship is ever lasting. In the long run, you will be known by the relation you had with colleagues and not by achieving targets of a particular assignment.</p>
