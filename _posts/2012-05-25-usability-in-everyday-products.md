# Usability in Everyday Products

<p>In our day to day life we use many products; some are nice to use others are not so nice. But at times you will come across a few such products, which are really difficult to use and not at all <span style="color: #ff6600;"><b><i>User Friendly</i></b></span>. Well that brings the hell.<!--more--></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff6600;"><i>What does User Friendly mean?</i></span></p>
<p>In a layman term "User Friendly" means that the product is easy to use, and that the person using it won't have a hard time learning how to use it or have problems while using it. Can you think of any such product? Well I can think of my TV Remote to start with. The same fundamental goes neck to neck with Software Products too. Can you think of any such software product? Well I find it very easy to use Facebook. Do you feel the same? Let’s explore.</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff6600;"><i>Understanding Usability in real time</i></span></p>
<p>If I say it’s with Apple iPhone; you may find it hard to believe. Couple of week’s back home key of my iPhone stopped functioning. I took it to the service center, I was hoping that they will change the key and life will be back. I was shocked when they said “It’s just not repairable, you may have to throw it away”. I was very lucky that my phone was under warranty; they replaced it with a new iPhone. Point here is that a small key if it’s not functioning, the whole iPhone is gone. Just imagine that your BMW car key is not working. You may be thinking that apple might have made the mobile like that for their marketing strategy. You may be right, but the learning here is “ You may have to go one step ahead to think <b>What if the Submit/Close/Clear image button was not able to download due to slow speed?”</b>.</p>
<p>My second usability example is Toll Gate on NH-8 Delhi to Gurgaon Road. Daily in the morning and evening I spend half-an-hour to cross those 500 meters. I want to blame here the design owner of usability. I think you all will agree with me that it could have been designed better, so that we all should have been proud of. Three major problems that I see creating the problem are:
<ul>  <br />
  <li>people taking U-turn</li>
  <li>moving from tag line to cash and vice-versa</li>
  <li>vehicle countat peak hours</li>
</ul></p>
<p>I think this problem could have been avoided if these three points where consider before building it.</p>
<p>Third one for ICICI Bank online web app. Majority of us uses online banking for billing and fund transfer. When you transfer fund in another account from your account, a unique digits of your ATM/Debit Card Grid (This will be at the back side of the card, attached is the pic PaymentDatagrid.png) is mandatory to complete the transactions. Digits on the card are real small, so user basically have to hold the card in hand. Problem is that when you start entering the digits, which has limitation of 2 characters in each textbox (input box) user is not automatically switch to next textbox (input box) for entering new digit number. One has to use mouse or tab key to move to next textbox (input box), which is not so ease holding the card handy. Point here is that sometime <i>such a small missing app feature, creates a bad usability experience. I have written a mail to them; hopefully they will correct that in their next release.</p>
