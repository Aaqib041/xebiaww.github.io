# Scrum and Timeboxing

This article is all about the key point of scrum i.e. timeboxing. How timeboxing increases motivation and productivity of team members.

Applying agile is not only a process implementation. It’s more of understanding human behaviour and changing the mindset as per agile principles and values. Most of the organizations use scrum out of all the methodologies of agile. According to Agile Version one’s survey conducted in 2012, 54% of organizations use Scrum and rest of them use other agile methods.

Scrum is timeboxed and motivates team members to complete work within the timeboxes. Result is increase in productivity. Scrum flow is mentioned below:

**Scrum Flow**

![Scrum Flow][1]

Here we commit for the selected work in sprint planning meeting. Within the sprint work moves from  To Do, Ongoing and Done but the count of items in the board remains same. At the end of the timebox or sprint every item goes in Done.

Working in timeboxes is equals to creating short milestones and achieving these milestones in a continuous manner.

The reason of this we can understand by **Temporal Motivation Theory.**

**Temporal motivation theory** (TMT) is developed by **Piers Steel **and **Cornelius J. Konig**, the theory emphasizes time as a critical, motivational factor. The Temporal Motivation Theory formula can be applied to the human behavior, procrastination and to goal setting. According to Lord, Diefenforff, Schmidt and Hall, the theory models the motivating power of approaching deadlines, arguing that the perceived utility of a given activity increases exponentially as the deadline nears.

**Temporal Motivation Theory Formula**

![TMT formula][2]

 

Where,

Motivation          =    the desire for a particular outcome

Expectancy        =    the probability of success

Value                  =   the reward associated with the outcome

Impulsiveness     =   the individual’s sensitivity to delay

To see how temporal motivation theory can be applied in an example, consider a student given one month to study for a final exam. The student is given two options—studying and socializing. The student enjoys socializing but needs to achieve a good grade. The reward of studying is not immediate thus at the beginning of the student's study period, the motivation to study is lower than the motivation to socialize. However, as the study period diminishes from several weeks to several days, the motivation to study will surpass the motivation to socialize.

That’s the reason why working in timeboxes increases team motivation hence the productivity.

So to select the proper timebox is one of the key to success.
