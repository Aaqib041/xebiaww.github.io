# Xpressions iPhone/iPod app

Smartphones have made a deep impact on our lives. Applications not only provide services to the users or entertain them, but connect to them at an emotional level.

At Xebia we strive to build apps that connect with users. Our first step in this direction was [Talking Photos][1], an app which enables a user to speak out his feelings and experiences related to an image and tie them onto the image in the iPhone, thus sealing them in memories.

Our next app [Kalorific][2] empowered the user to keep track of his calorie intake, providing him a comparitive view of the calories that different eatables added to his diet. **Our latest app [Xpressions][3] adds an entirely new dimension to the way feelings can be expressed**. The joy on the face of your loved one, when they see magical rose petals swirl around the iPhone screen and slowly rearrange into a custom message, cannot be expressed in mere words, rather as the following video shows, it can only be experienced.
