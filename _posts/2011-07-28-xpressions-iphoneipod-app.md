# Xpressions iPhone/iPod app

<p>Smartphones have made a deep impact on our lives. Applications not only provide services to the users or entertain them, but connect to them at an emotional level.</p>
<p>At Xebia we strive to build apps that connect with users. Our first step in this direction was <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/talking-photos/id404521194?mt=8">Talking Photos</a>, an app which enables a user to speak out his feelings and experiences related to an image and tie them onto the image in the iPhone, thus sealing them in memories.</p>
<p>Our next app <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/kalorific/id431603274?mt=8">Kalorific</a> empowered the user to keep track of his calorie intake, providing him a comparitive view of the calories that different eatables added to his diet. <strong>Our latest app <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xpressions/id438903561?mt=8">Xpressions</a> adds an entirely new dimension to the way feelings can be expressed</strong>. The joy on the face of your loved one, when they see magical rose petals swirl around the iPhone screen and slowly rearrange into a custom message, cannot be expressed in mere words, rather as the following video shows, it can only be experienced.</p>
