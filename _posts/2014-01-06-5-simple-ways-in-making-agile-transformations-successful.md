# 5 Simple Ways in Making Agile Transformations Successful 

<p>If you read my last post I talked about why <a href="http://xebee.xebia.in/index.php/2013/12/17/why-agile-transformation-fails/">Agile Transformation fails</a> ; the objective as consultants is to make sure every <a href="http://www.agilecoach.ca/2013/08/23/70-failure-rate-myth/">transformation is successfu</a>l.</p>
<p>Today, let’s focus on the things that will help you steer the transformation towards success. Apart from the right planning and knowing the limitations of your clients (as to how much you can do at one go), here are few things to consider:</p>
<p>• <strong>Start with Bottom up Estimates</strong>- Giving the team entire control of how much work is delivered. While this should bring in some sense of responsibility and accountability to the team, it also depends how well the scrum master and the team is groomed and trained to handle it. This is the normally done with all teams when estimations are done and given during Grooming’s or Sprint Planning.</p>
<p>• <strong>Include top down estimation</strong>- When a team has been stable and has been doing well, it’s time to bring in Release Planning. And it does exactly what it says; however it brings in the concept of top down estimation as well. Which means every Product Owner or Product Manager should also know and be able to approximate how much his or her team can deliver. This is based on the past trends, the interlinking of how Features and User Stories are predicted and how much can ne actually delivered. The benefit of including top down estimate is, it distributes the decision making to both the teams and the management to ensure that the committed stories are delivered on time and the release planning for quarter or a ear is based on realism and doesn't have to be changed often.</p>
<p>• <strong>Assessments</strong>- You can also include assessments once in a while to see if the transformation is coming along as planned. You can ask stakeholders, functional managers and teams about the positive changes and create your own questionnaire or you can some of the available ones like the <a href="http://comparativeagility.com/files/ADP08_AssessingYourAgility.pdf">Comparative Agile Assessment</a>  or the <a href="http://www.academia.edu/993592/The_Shodan_Adherence_Survey_for_Extreme_Programming_Sheffield_Revision_1">Shodan Adherence Survey</a>. This will definitely help you get an understanding on how the strategy needs to be fixed or changed.</p>
<p>• <strong>Referring theories is a job half done</strong>- You will always have consultants or sometimes even members from the tea, who will refer to you about other theories in the market and several books and question why they are not being implemented. Or it can be vice-versa where we can just refer to something that worked with our last client. Every client or team is different and every solution should be customized to make things work easily.</p>
<p>• <strong>Be friendly, authoritative and open to new ideas</strong>- Just because you are a consultant doesn't mean we earn the right to order people around, making others comfortable during the change is the first and most important part of the job. Teams open up easily once they have find you trustworthy and who is ready to listen.</p>
<p>Communicate, understand, do your homework and get help when required to make sure your clients feels you are doing more than what they expected out of you. Every day is a new day and more challenges you have better it is. In meeting the challenges you have just created more work.</p>
