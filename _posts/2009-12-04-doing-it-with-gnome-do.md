# Doing it with Gnome-Do

<p><img src="http://xebee.xebia.in/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/Gnome-Do.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>I heard about <strong>Gnome-Do</strong> a while back and I thought, "Oh no! not another dock creator for Linux to emulate the Mac look", there are many who have been there and failed, so I left it alone for a while. In my never-ending quest for the perfect desktop, I finally installed* it a while back. And now I am completely hooked.</p>

<p>So what is Gnome-Do, to explain its usage lets take a simple example - how do you open Eclipse IDE in your desktop? You click on the main menu icon, hover onto the menu category and then click on Eclipse. That is a minimum of 2 mouse clicks along with some mouse movement.</p>
<p>Now if you are like me, and don't like to leave the comfort of your keyboard and you have Gnome-Do installed all you need to do is press Super (the Windoze key) + Space and type "Eclipse" (you may get the Eclipse icon even as you type "e + c"), as soon as the icon is highlighted press [ENTER] and voila Eclipse appears on to your screen.</p>

<p>You can do the same for Firefox, click on Super + Space -&gt; Type "Fire" -&gt; Press [ENTER]. Thus any application on your system can be launched with a few keystrokes. Now, that is convenient! No need to create desktop shortcuts and no need to even touch the mouse to launch applications.</p>
<p>There are some neat plugins available for Gnome-Do as well, for example the <strong>Google Search Plugin</strong>, no need to open the browser, just launch Do (Super + Space) -&gt; Type "Search Google" -&gt; [TAB] -&gt; Search String -&gt; [ENTER] -&gt; Select from search results -&gt; [ENTER].</p>
<p>The <strong>Locate File Plugin</strong> is great as well. Launch Do (Super + Space) -&gt; type "Locate" -&gt; [TAB] -&gt; type file name -&gt; [ENTER] -&gt; Select file and press [ENTER]. Plugin installation is also a breeze and can be done with a few clicks.</p>
<p>Finally, for all the dock lovers, Gnome-Do also comes in with a dock manager called <strong>Docky</strong>. If you like docks you can set Docky to be always visible and get a Mac like look, or set it to auto-hide.</p>
<p>With Gnome-Do, you have no excuse for a cluttered desktop, no need for desktop shortcuts and no need to have quick-launch icons. <strong>Just press Super + Space and do it!</strong></p>

<li>Gnome-Do is available for all Linux distros, it works with KDE as well. To install on Ubuntu just type "<strong>sudo apt-get install gnome-do</strong>".</li>
