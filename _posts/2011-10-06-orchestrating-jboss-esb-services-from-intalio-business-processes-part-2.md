# Orchestrating JBoss ESB Services from Intalio business processes (Part-2)

In this video series, we are going to learn how to orchestrate jboss services from within Intalio BPM processes.

In the part 1 Â <http://xebee.xebia.in/2011/09/26/orchestrating-jboss-services-from-intalio-business-processes-part-1/> we have created a JBoss ESB service and published it as a web service. This part will focus more on the Intalio BPM and will show you how to call the JBoss ESB service from within the process.
