# General Guidelines for UML Diagram

<p>After making allot of mistakes in the UML diagrams, reading books and taking feedbacks I was actually able to make some clear and more understandable of them. This was always a problem; to make it better one I always ended up in making it more complex.</p>
<p>My first impression was the more complex it is (having more lines and boxes with allot of abbreviations), the more professional or impressive it looks like. And later I realized more the complex, more the crap it is. Thus UML is to make complex business rules/coding and other logics understandable using diagrams, so the diagram should be simple enough to read and digest. UML holds no value if the diagram is equally complex as reading code or text document.</p>

<p>Following are few important points I learned that should be kept in mind while creating any type of UML diagram simpler, so take them as general guidelines for a neat UML</p>
<p>1.    <strong>Lines </strong>– Lines fluster you maximum. Even a simple scenario can become enough complex to read or understand if lines makes a mess. We should be very careful with lines while drawing any kind of UML diagram. Try not to let one line (such as association) cross over the other. If it’s not possible to get rid of lines crossing over then try to hop one line over other. Lines should always be straight and they should either be made horizontal or vertical, they are easier for your eyes to follow than diagonal or curved lines.</p>
<p>2.    <strong>Symbols </strong>– The most important element of the diagram is the symbol. One of the common problem I have seen (and even I use to make) was having different sizes of symbols based on how many lines are associated with that class or how many methods it has. However this is a bad practice i.e. having different sizes of different symbols. Try to make all the symbols of same size, and if you want to emphasize any symbol then you can rather use colour coding of text, underline or may be a text symbol. Also the lines and symbols should be organized symmetrically i.e. aligned uniformly and try having table structure.</p>
<p>3.    <strong>Make it clear</strong> – Do have some white space in your diagram and show only what makes sense, believe me you don’t need to show all the elements of a class in the symbol. If the diagram is getting bigger and bigger, then try to break this large diagram in to several small diagrams. Ideally a diagram should not have more than 9 symbols because there is a limit on the amount of information one can read at one go. Another rule on the size of the diagram is, a diagram should be printable on one paper, thus, stop extending the diagram as soon as it goes out of print size of one page.
Never use esoteric notations, try to make it simple English acceptable      everywhere.</p>
<p>4.    <strong>Content </strong>– The content has more importance than the beauty of the diagram, ones we have enough good content in the diagram, even a bad layout looks more readable or understandable. Try to put notes, legends in your diagram and make sure they have consistent font size. Assort the notes at a single place at any corner and make it consistent throughout all the diagrams.</p>
<p>5.    <strong>Nomenclature </strong>– Whichever patterns you choose for naming conventions make sure it remain consistent throughout. Try to have functionality, flow or domain based terminology, this helps in having a common convention for both business and technical people. And the most important thing, the common symbols should have same names throughout all the diagrams. Having stereotypes is not a good option, rather we should be having meaningful names/words, but in case you want to use them then use lowercase for stereotypes that are spelled out fully, such as &lt;&lt;whatever&gt;&gt; instead of &lt;&lt;Whatever &gt;&gt;, and use all uppercase for stereotypes that are abbreviations, such as &lt;&lt;XYZ &gt;&gt; instead of &lt;&lt;Xyz &gt;&gt; or &lt;&lt;xyz&gt;&gt;.</p>
