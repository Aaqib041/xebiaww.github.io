to be top class in everything and not just limited to quality coding. Quality should be like the blood flowing from top to bottom every minute.

In my experience, many people usually give less importance to writing emails. Email is the virtual face of you. The choice of words, tone, knowledge of target audience and clarity reflects your personality. We must take email writing very seriously and strive for perfection in this skill as well. Though definition of Quality is not limited to what is explained in the following diagram, but this diagram explains some of the key attributes of office life where Quality must be practiced.
