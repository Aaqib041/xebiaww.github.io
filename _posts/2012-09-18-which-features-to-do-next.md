# Which features to do next?

Managing priority of features for a product is a challenge in itself. The challenge further becomes daunting when there are multiple stakeholders involved, and you as a decision maker is caught up in between conflict of interest of various stakeholders.

In such situations, what basis do you use to prioritize features? The answer lies in the quote by Roy Disney, "It's not hard to make decisions when you know what your values are." For many people, value of a feature means the business value of financial value, but there are many other attributes that demand serious consideration.

Following are common metrics that can be used to base the product decision upon. I have further categorized them on the basis of motivation behind their inclusion.

**Requirement Source**(to some extent frequency of requirement is also important)

  * How much is this desirable? (Results of Kano analysis can be useful)

  * Who asked for it? (Bigger customer might have a bigger say)

  * What is your gut feeling about it? (Own knowledge matters, especially in the case of New Product Development)

**Product vision and company objectives alignment**

  * How much financial or business value does it provide?

  * When does it provide the value? (Product return schedule)

  * How much does it cost?

    * Development?

    * Maintenance?

    * Dependencies? Skills or resource availability?

  * Is there a market-specific opportunity?

  * Is there a penalty for not doing it now?

**Opportunity for product investment**

  * How much technical knowledge we would gain from it?

  * How much domain knowledge we would gain from it?

  * Does it improve product's user experience?

  * How much risk is mitigated by doing it?

While coming up with a list of attributes is important, what is more important is to put a value against the attribute. Weighted sum of different attributes value would assist in decision making, as it would adjust influences of various attributes on particular life-cycle of a product.
