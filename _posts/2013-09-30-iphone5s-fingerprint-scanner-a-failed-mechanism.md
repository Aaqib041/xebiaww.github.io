# iPhone5S Fingerprint Scanner : A failed mechanism ?

With a Finger Print Scanner in iPhone5s Apple has made a grand attempt to bring Biometric Scanners at the center stage of our everyday lives. Though several companies have in the past provided option of bio-metric scanners in Laptops but considering the quantum of their sales and then number of people using them are a minuscule percentage.  But Apple now stands different for some specific reasons

1)  They are bringing Biometric scanners for authentications in Mobile phones and will also be providing API's for 3Rd party apps to use it.  Now Biometric scanners in the past have never been trusted as the reliable method of authentication. They have always been used as one of the secondary systems of authentication. Think of the guards with Machine guns manning the door of defense facilities, checking the I-cards despite of steel doors with biometric access.  Reason is Biometric scanner scanner in the past have been fooled so many techniques and most of them do not even require even basic technical knowledge for execution.

When apple is making the argument of using fingerprints for authentication on its iPhones and later on for app passwords and financial transactions. They are only writing a recipe of disaster. Because if fingerprint are used as primary authentication mechanisms. People will use fingers of sleeping people to open their phones and steal data. Dead people will be digged out of their graves for the sake of their finger prints to perform transaction on their name even after they are dead. More over iPhones fingerprint scanner have been successfully fooled by two of the verified techniques.

First hack was demonstrated by hackers at chaos computer club in Germany who created spoofed fingerprints by using Pink Latex milk and White wood glue. They simply clicked high resolution pictures of fingerprints on a used glass and then printed fingerprints on a white plastic sheet with thick toner settings on a high-resolution (around 1200 DPI) printer. They then poured Pink latex milk and wood glue on the sheet and then took of the plastic after it dried. The artificial finger was then used on the iPhone to open it. And to make a point all the material they used can be found in any house. So imagine how easy it must be to spoof fingerprints.

Second hack was revealed yesterday by a group of Iranian friends who demonstrated that Apple's architecture of storing multiple scans of a person's finger print could be used as vulnerability.  They stored the fingers prints of a group of people instead on one person which fingerprint induction in iPhone and to a great laughter iPhone started opening even if there was a 30% match of any of the stored fingerprints. Result:  To much of disbelief a group fingerprint or family fingerprint can be created. Now authentication being passed even with 30% fingerprint is match is not only unsafe but disastrous and for sure apple can’t even fix this anytime soon.

 2) Apple not only owns the iPhone but also its operating system and even the company which manufactures the hardware of its biometric scanners. For the first time in IT history a Private company is going to collect fingerprints on such a massive scale and privacy and legal concerns are overflowing. Can a private company be even allowed to collect fingerprints on such a massive scale? There are no laws, no regulations, no legislation in most of the countries as of now and with privacy debate raging after NSA spying this is going to be a serious issue in many countries.

Though Tim Cook made a categorical statement during the launch that fingerprints of users will not be stored in a central server so there was no possibility of any threat or misuse. But we all know why he had to make that statement. The reason is PRISM. Apple has been one of the topmost affiliate data providers in PRISM, a mass surveillance program run by US NSA.

Not storing fingerprints on a Central Server is one thing but having the ability to access them, fetch them and store them is something different. Tim cook has never denied the capability of apple to do the same. The massive spying program run by NSA under the name of PRISM , collects every single possible information and data of users and machines from several companies in US and it all countries. Apple is one of its top most program affiliates and provides every bit of data on its users to NSA. Since they are legally bound to do it under court order so it cannot be denied that Apple can tomorrow act as a fingerprint collection agency for US spy machine NSA. These concerns and fears have been a matter of worldwide debate since the launch of Apple iPhone5s  So we must not be fooled down by the Apple, its biometric scanner and even your own finger. Apple gimmick of future authentication through finger prints is a failed idea. Those who less care will still use it. There will still be crowds at Apple stores for iPhone5S.But at the end of the day it all boils down to one fundamental argument and basic principal of authentication mechanisms.

You can change you passwords but you can’t change your finger prints and worse you leave them everywhere, every day.
