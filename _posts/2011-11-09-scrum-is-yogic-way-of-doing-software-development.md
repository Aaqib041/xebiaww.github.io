# Scrum is Yogic way of doing software development

Last few weeks I’ve been reading Speaking Tree – a weekend supplement of ‘Times of India’ and as I read every week, I felt there are lot of similarities between Yoga practice and Scrum philosophy. I’d like to share my perspective on how Yoga and Scrum overlap each other.

**What is a product here?**

The product in the case of Yoga is our body (including mind). The product backlog is the list of issues/problems/ that you would like to fix in your body & mind to enhance it. These issues could be physical problems or mental and emotional.

**Different roles:**

Product Owner – It’s YOU. You are the owner of your body! Hence you will define roadmap for your mind and body.

The Team – It’s all your body parts - your head, hands, legs, lungs, heart (**Imagine the level of collaboration!**)

Scrum Master – Your brain – Toughest part of yoga is to keep a check on your thoughts and evade distractions/obstacles to concentrate on your goal which is to be able to meditate and, do the asanas (work on sprint tasks) without disturbance.

**Sprint Goal**: Happy product Owner (You)

Sprint planning meeting: Prayer in each class where you make the commitment to end your 'issues'. You also commit not to add more items in the sprint till you clear the existing items (obviously you would not want more problems!)

**The Scrum Cycle in Yoga**

As a product owner you demand that you need the best product (mind and body). You have a list of issues (product backlogs); some of which you commit to a particular yoga class (sprint). You want your body parts (the team) to work collaboratively to complete the asanas (tasks) that will help you get the best body (product).

Your Brain (The Scrum master), helps you perform each asana (task) by removing any resistance and helping you focus. The more your brain is able to collaborate with each body part (team) the smoother is completion of asanas (tasks).

**_There are different stages of yoga; you can't skip a level to achieve the pinnacle in yoga - it is a gradual progression._**

This is true in scrum too; where teams achieve excellence by gradually progressing through different stages of completion like - continuous integration--> continuous deployment-->continuous delivery.

Teams need to follow basic scrum practices to achieve sustained productivity and then move on to follow advanced practices to attain hyper productivity.

Interestingly our body is not designed to handle ‘big bang’ changes, it seeks incremental changes for itself to adapt to the ultimate change we want in your body.

**_It is very interesting to notice that the essence of yoga is so inherent in scrum. This is testimony to the power of Scrum. So, get going and get yourself some Yoga and Scrum_**. 

**Do you mind being called a ‘Scrum Yogi’?**
