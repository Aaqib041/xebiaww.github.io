# WTP, M2 eclipse plugin integration

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Let me write my first blog here. Very briefly-
I wrote an article on how WTP, M2 eclipse plugin can be made to integrate together so that we can as developers leverage the benefits of both in Java dynamic web application projects that are using Maven 2. This article has been published by "devx.com".</p>
<p>Now we need not wait for the two -"M2 eclipse plugin" and "WTP" to perfect their integration.</p>
<p>The article : <a href="http://www.devx.com/Java/Article/36785"> WTP, M2 eclipse plugin integration</a></p>
<p>Currently the article is also on the home page of <a href="http://www.devx.com"> devx </a></p>
