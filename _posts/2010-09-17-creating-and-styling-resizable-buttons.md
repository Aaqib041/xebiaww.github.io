# Creating and Styling Resizable ‹input› Buttons

Last week I came across a new requirement in my project where tapestry is used. Project requirement: Internationalization, where language of the content, image text everything is changed as per the language selected. Client was very happy with curve edge button which also had gradient and embossed effect. These effects cannot be generated by using filter, alpha, or opacity property in CSS, which is again not browser compatible so finally the conclusion I thought was to use image. Earlier the project requirement was to support two languages. So I made the button width slightly bigger which could accommodate text for both languages. But later, other two languages were added and the labels were now too long. For example “Submit” in English, "Voorleggen" in Dutch, "Presentar" in Spanish ,"Soumettre" in French and so on. To elaborate, here is the example of <input> element created button which renders according to language selected.

Creating one time style is easy to use throughout the project. Then we do not need to create each button image, which increases the processing time and bandwidth in loading a site. Also it is not flexible enough to stretch according to label of the button and is very light in size as single image is used which is reused for different button. I tried to Google but hardly could find any solution for <input> element button. The most of the solution were for <button> element and <a href> element but could not find anything about <input> element submit button. <input/> tag does not have close tag where we can reside <span> or <p> in it and assigned class to it like we do for <button> or for <a href>. I found by using [sourcecode language="html"]<button><span><span>Label</span></span></button>[/sourcecode] or [sourcecode language="html"] <a href="#"><span>submit</span></a>[/sourcecode] We can create and style resizable buttons. But in tapestry when we have to provide two action “Submit” and “Cancel” we cannot use <button> html element. We were using t:id=”…” t:value=”…” t:type=”…” which is not supported to perform two action on a form. In <button> tag we are using <span> tag to show the label which will appear on button, as the <button> tag has open and close tag, like [sourcecode language="html"]<button><span><span>Label</span></span></button>[/sourcecode] Using sliding doors we can have buttons flexible, where background image expand with the size of the button's text. I will be using sliding doors technique where two complementing images creating the illusion of a single, stretching image to create my <input> button. Here is the way I created my <input> button. You can also download the demo file from [here](/2010/09/17/creating-and-styling-resizable-buttons/input-buttonfile/) [sourcecode language="html"] <!-- This div is container of the buttons, if you want to place it on right or left side just assign new css class which float it to right/left --> <div> <!--This div contain the small piece of left side of button image, fix width image --> <div> <!--Input button with the css class --> <input type="submit" id="previous" value="&#171; previous" /> <! -- Div with left side of image close here --> </div> <! -- Spacer image for creating space between two images with float left css style --> <img src="images/spacer.gif" width="20" height="1"></img> <!--This div contain the small piece of left side of button image, fix width image --> <div> <!--Input button with the css class --> <input type="submit" id="next" value="next &#187;" /> <! -- Div with left side of image close here --> </div> <! -- Container div ends --> </div> [/sourcecode] **Style created for input button:** [sourcecode language="html"] <style> .button_placeholder { border:none; } /* Buttonimage-new.png is 700px in width, which is used in background with right top */ .button_style_enabled { font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; color: #ffffff; background: url(images/Buttonimage-new.png) no-repeat right top; text-align:center; cursor:pointer; height:29px; border:0px; margin:0px; font-weight:bold; vertical-align:middle; padding:0 15px; } .button_style_enabled:hover { background: url(images/Buttonimagehover-new.png) no-repeat right top; border:0px; margin:0px; } .button_style_enabled_edge { background: url(images/left-Buttonimage.png) no-repeat left top; height:29px; border:0px; margin:0px; padding-left:2px; } .left_float { float:left; } </style> [/sourcecode] **Images used in the button are: **(I am using 700 width image for long button to fit in it.)

This is how the buttons look like, if you have any question or any other solution please let me know, as this is just a trick to get the output
