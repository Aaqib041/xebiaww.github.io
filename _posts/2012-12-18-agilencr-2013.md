# AgileNCR 2013 - Colloquium for all-round Agility

In the spirit of showcasing the most salient developments in Agile today, **Xebia** proudly announces the **[AgileNCR](http://agilencr.xebia.in/) **2013 conference, scheduled to take place in **February ‘13**.

Initiated years ago with the guiding objective of lauding ingenuity, and spreading knowledge within the software community, **AgileNCR** has since become the most pioneering of Agile events in India. Renowned international speakers, industry patrons, agile gurus and several seasoned agilists; for instance,** Pete Deemer**, **Sanjiv Augustine**, **Serge Beaumont**, **Hedwig Baars** and **Rini van Soligen**, have been associated with the conference time and time again.

Always endeavouring to acknowledge innovation in agility, this is the ideal platform for agile enthusiasts to share ideas, and for people and organizations that are seeking to explore and adapt to an agile work-culture and paradigm.

**AGENDA**

This time around, AgileNCR plans to bring forth an altogether fresh perspective towards holistic enterprise agility, with four sub-conferences spanning across the multifarious ethos and elements that encompass it. The first, **Pragmatic Agile Adoption**, will highlight a practical approach towards adoption of agile practices, the challenges posed, and the pivotal benefits reaped by overcoming them. This conference would comprise experience sharing sessions, case studies and white papers on Agile-Driven Process Efficiency, Team Agility, Scrum, Enterprise Agile Adoption, Distributed Development Best Practices, Agile Planning and Estimation, Agile Requirements Management, Agile Anti-Patterns and other related areas.

The second, would be the **Executive Conclave**, featuring the theme of making agility work for business, and how business leaders can effectively introduce agile in their respective business environments, for mitigating risk and delivering quality. This stream will expound upon Leadership in Agile Transformation, Agile Scaling, Agile Contracts, Building an Agile Organization, role of executive and middle management in Agile Adoption, and the measurement and forecast of business results.

Thirdly, there's the **Tech Huddle**, catering to the more technically inclined audience, with sessions elaborating upon the latest trends and tools that support agile deliveries, while demonstrating the merits of an agile approach to the same. It will include topics like Agile Engineering Best Practices, Maximizing Productivity as an Agile Developer, Agile Testing, Continuous Integration, Behavior-Driven Development (BDD), Test-Driven Development (TDD), Acceptance Test Driven Development (ATDD), OpenShift PaaS, etc.

Lastly, we present **New Age HR**. The Human Resources team has a crucial role to play in the success of Agile Teams. Hence, there is much to be said about what is to be expected while hiring a potential team member, what special skills agile teams require, and how to appraise an agile team members.
