# Exploratory Testing - an Agile approach

The following is an excerpt of my paper on '[Exploratory Testing - an Agile approach][1]'. It was selected for the publication by the organizers of the STC (Software Testing Conference 2009) held at Bangalore, India.  
As the IT industry is growing and getting older more mature approaches for the development of the software are emerging which are more effective and fast as compared to the traditional one. The organizations that are traditional invest heavily in implementing test methodologies. These methodologies usually require testers to start writing the test cases as soon as the requirement document is there. In this approach there are many formalities such as creating the documents for each step and then maintaining them.  
Now organizations are moving towards more agile, informal and an iterative approach – an “Agile approach”. Being informal, testers are not required to write the test cases rather they can concentrate more on exploring the application and can focus on testing it. This approach of testing and exploring the application is referred to as ‘Exploratory Testing’. It’s a technique through which one can learn the application and can uncover most of the bugs at an early stage and then can add new and better test cases for the functionality.  
This paper concentrates more on the Exploratory Testing as a technique, suggests how and when ET should be included in the testing strategy, in what situations it is most useful, and which aspects of the testing process should never be exploratory or agile. This paper also throws light on a concept called "paired testing".  
The full paper can be viewed [here][1].
