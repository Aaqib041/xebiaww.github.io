<!--In building hyperproductive fully distributed Scrum teams, leadership is very important. One leadership pattern that always surfaces is the nut / bolt pattern where two leading team members from both sides work together and pull the whole team close as a result.-->

# The nut/bolt pattern for distributed Scrum development

<p>Recently on LinkedIn in the Agile Project Management Group I came across a very interesting discussion started by Donna Reed. She asked <a title="LinkedIn discussion" href="http://www.linkedin.com/e/ava/9456912/69301/EML_anet_qa_ttle-0St79xs2RVr6JBpnsJt7dBpSBA/" target="_blank">Can an Agile Team be Distributed &amp; Successfull?</a>. This discussion was following her <a title="Donna Reed on Fully Distributed Scrum" href="http://www.donnaareed.com/agile-distributed-development-done-right-using-fully-distributed-scrum/" target="_self">blogpost</a> about one of my presentations that was <a title="Schoonheim, Fully Distributed Scrum" href="http://www.infoq.com/presentations/fully-distributed-scrum" target="_blank">recently published on InfoQ.com</a>.</p>
<p>Her question is what experiences other people have with making Agile distributed development reach a hyperproductive state with similar performance to good local teams. This is our core business at Xebia and it is very interesting to read how other people are experiencing this.</p>
<p>In the discussion where a lot of people gave their points of view and shared experiences on the matter she reached a very interesting conclusion.<!--more--></p>
<p><em><strong>"There is the "perfect world"....and then there is "our world"....and I'm finding from most people that distributed/virtual teams can work and do work, but you need a leader that knows how to enable virtual teams. This is not a skill that most people have, so co-location is highly recommended." </strong></em></p>
<p>Where Donna is absolutely right is that leadership is a very important ingredient to making distributed teams work. As with all new things, an experienced leader can speed up the learning process, help break impasse and make it all an enjoyable exciting team experience instead of a stressful problematic period.</p>
<p>What I do not agree with is that this is so hard that you should revert to co-location and thereby never build up this leadership experience. Applying proven patterns and practices combined with strong introspection and rigorously improving every iteration will get you there!</p>

I see this recurring again and again.</p>
<p>This is what I call <strong>the nut / bolt pattern,</strong>.</p>
<p>Successful fully distributed teams have leaders on both sides that actively bring the team together. They act as the nut and the bolt that pull other team members close into a single whole.</p>
<p>Lets give an example from a recent Xebia project.</p>
<p>One of our teams distributed across India and the Netherlands was having a lower velocity then expected and stress levels were building. As this pressure rises the first reaction of the onsite team members is often to distance themselves from the offshore team members and do more on their own. They are in the same room and they are quick to understand each other. This was starting to happen in this project as well.</p>
<p>At this point the ScrumMaster in the Netherlands and the most senior team member in India discussed this, had the courage to put all differences on the table and to work it out as partners (our ScrumMasters are always developers in the team they guide). The leadership of these two heroes cleared up communication and rapidly got the team into a stable productive state again where they still are today.</p>
<p>By acting as a nut and a bolt their communication and partnership removed impediments in working distributed and this leadership pulled the entire team close as a result.</p>
<p>I have witnessed this leadership pattern in almost all exceptional distributed teams that we have formed over the years, and we have had quite a lot of exceptional teams.</p>
<p><em><strong>Conclusion</strong></em></p>
<p>When you are working in a fully distributed team (a single scrum team with members on multiple locations) communication is the most important thing to get right. Think about who can be the nut and bolt in your distributed team and help them assume those roles. TheirÂ  personal link based on mutual respect, good will and eventually friendship will be your conduit for success.</p>
