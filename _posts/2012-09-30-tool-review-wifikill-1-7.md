# Tool Review : WifiKill 1.7

**Here we go :**

I rooted my Samsung Galaxy note yesterday night to try out some new mobile apps which a friend of mine got from recent Defcon. Though most of the apps were android based security tools, The latest version of app Called WifiKill Reminded college days when we used to run Netcut on windows to kick out some neighbors from Hostel Wifi to save precious bandwidth for our counterstrike servers :). For those who haven't used Netcut, It is a windows based app which used ARP based spoofing attacks to kick out any machine from same network virtually disabling their internet connection.  Now WifiKill 1.7 looks like some new born cousin of Netcut. It can be installed on any Android based phone and can be used to eject any machine from the network with in few moments. The app in 1.7 versions appears to have become considerably fast in scanning networks. Its features include right from scanning your WiFi network for devices, see their MAC addresses and May be if you want to send some lessons by kicking out some of those bandwidth hoggers who live and die on torrents and show no respect for others by slowing net connectivity, This app allows you to to cut network connection for specified devices and get rid of those bandwidth suckers. Other Interesting feature includes redirection of HTTP traffic to specific IPs.

**Lets check it out on Android ICS.**

Like all the apps like Netcut, facesniff or wifikill uses the similar logic of spoofing ARP packets  and trick the target devices into thinking that your Android device is the actual router and starts dropping all their packets which in turn creates a  illusion for target devices  to believe that it is still connected to network but internet is slow or speed issues.

Only drawback i could find in this  app is  that it works only with rooted Android devices  but still its superb User friendliness and lightening scanning  speed gives it comparative advantage when compared to other tools like Facesniff.  Moreover WifiKill can also be  used by network administrators  to control Internet usage and Bandwidth usage under control. They can stall or kill  Wifi-Internet connectivity of any user in required circumstances But at the same time this app also demonstrates the  weak  Wi-Fi security world is facing these day where anybody can with a wink stall the connectivity of anyone  on the same Wifi Network.

**Can i get Caught ?**

This also leads us to a interesting Question. Is there any possibility of  being caught if you are killing the connectivity of anyone using WifiKill ? That too at some Public Wifi like the ones at McDonald's ?   Technically, yes.  If the network administrator goes on to  figure out the ARP poisioning.  He can look for the MAC address of  your phone and then using your MAC he can find out the manufacturer  or your phone model and then can search for it in the pocket of every Guest .  So Will you get caught doing it at a McDonald's ? No way :) 

Though  the Google has pulled out this app from the  Android Market but you can still get it from the XDA Developers forum and try out this app when you have time to test any Wifi Network with Your phone. ** The Lookout scanner in my phone gave Thumbs Up to WifiKill 1.7 but I would still recommend you to uninstall WifiKill1.7 after you trying as these apps are not above suspicion for the background wonders when they have the Super User Permissions :)
