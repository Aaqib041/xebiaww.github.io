# Turning Public Charging Stations into Data Readers

The World is in a transition phase of moving from normal mobile phones to Smart Phones, There appears to be a race among all manufacturers to provide powers full processors, increasing

storage capacities which have turned smart phone almost into handheld laptops. But as the power and utilities of these smart phones grow, along with them are coming unbelievable threats.

At the onset it may appear that a hacked Smartphone is a lesser threat then of a compromised computer. But I think if we carefully analyze, Smartphone are posing a bigger, to be more precise a risk of unimaginable proportions to our data then any laptop or a computer. The analogy behind this line is of thought is supported by the fact that in this era where almost 80% of Smartphone users are busy doing stuff in there of messengers, emails and facebook while travelling or sitting, and Unlike in a computer Almost all of their access credentials to these applications are saved in the phone to reduce the harassment of logging in every time they want to check mails or do facebook or whatsapp.

Almost of all of the widely used applications like facebook, or messengers like whatsapp are widely known for their notorious problem of draining the Smartphone batteries, often forcing users to charge their phones multiple times a day. Sometimes at public mobile charging stations available at places like airports, metro stations, shopping malls, coffee houses etc

In the recent Hackers Conference we demonstrated how these Public charging stations can be used along with the famous black art of Social Engineering to steal data from Smart phones within Minutes of being put on charging on these kiosks. Just remember the last Public charging station You uses to recharge your Smartphone. Did you check the source of Power Supply ????? May be you had dumped your data in that Kiosk then.

:) Here lies the Trick. Look at the Pictures below.

  * In A normal looking charging station
  * ![](/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/mobile-charging-stations-250x250.jpg)
  * we provided power supply from a pwn plug(A full fledged mini Linux machine without screen) instead of a electrical power plug.
  * ![](/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/USBCableChargingStationDanger-300x214.jpg)![](http://xebee.xebia.in/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/plug-300x225.jpg)
  * Now this Pwn plug was programmed to sucks all the pictures, videos, messages, even password stored in browser cache or may be take a complete dump of your phone.
  * The pwn plug also had a superb feature of running a 3G Sim card or even uses Wi Fi to provide remote access to itself from any outside machine. Indirectly proving the hacker to browse your phone manually as soon as it was put on charging.
  * Now we simply connected to the remote desktop of the pwn plug.
  * We then scanned the data in the smart phone which was being charged at our fake charging station

Many people who attended The Hackers Conference 2012 have plugged in their phones on this public charging station which was put at conference venue to charge their mobile batteries. Their stolen data was shown later on screen in conference to all. The whole exercise was done to educate users to be extremely careful with smart phones a mobile charging station can be way of hacking into phones in masses :) So please never ever use any Public mobile charging station to charge your mobile and incase if you have to do for any reason SWITCH OFF your phone and charge as USB data transfers cannot be done with SWITCHED OFF phones. Happy Charging.
