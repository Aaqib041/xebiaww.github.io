# Retrospective Action Points : Theory of Randomness

<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: arial;"><span style="font-size: small;">Problem : We had taken ~ 8 action point in the previous sprint and were about to start the retrospective. So while iterating over all the action points we found that we never achieved any action points in the sprint. Now this cycle carried on till next 4-5 sprints, we kept picking up ~8 action points but only managed to achieve one or two. To give you a break up of how we picked action points, We were a team of 6, there would be couple of action points for all, and everyone would pick up one or two action points based in the retrospective.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: arial;"><span style="font-size: small;"><!--more-->
</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: arial;"><span style="font-size: small;">One of the reason why we believed that we could not achieve action points was not allocating time in the sprint for the action points. Since we never explicitly allocated the time for the action points in the sprint we never were able to pick it up on first place. This resulted in stacking up the action points that need to be done. Certainly this can be a demotivator as in every retrospective you end up complaining about the same thing. So we agreed on keeping some time spare for the action points.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: arial;"><span style="font-size: small;">However the above approach also didn't work well. As most of the time stories, bugs, took over the priority. Also some points needed to be kept in mind throughout sprint execution based on distributed pairing,etc. </span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: arial;"><span style="font-size: small;">Like this we tried various approaches like discussing the action points one of the days after the standup. Well this approach did work partially. However discussing over 8-10 action points was too time consuming plus was difficult to concentrate on all of them at once.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: arial;"><span style="font-size: small;">So here is the actual problem we needed someone to remind us about the action points daily, but we didn't want to spend a lot of time discussing the action points. We wanted to start acting on them. Hence I developed the a application based on randomness.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: arial;"><span style="font-size: small;">Goal : Remind us about one action points everyday.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: arial;"><span style="font-size: small;">So here is what application does , Every time you start your machine , the application automatically starts up and will </span></span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: arial;"><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>randomly </strong></span></span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: arial;"><span style="font-size: small;">show you one action point.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: arial;"><span style="font-size: small;">Following two points are very essential for the application</span></span></span>
<ul>
    <li><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: arial;"><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>Randomness </strong>:   The reason I choose random is because  if everyday when I start my  machine I will be reminded about one of the points to be done.  Effectively all the 6 team mates will have one action item to think     about. Also at a time you can only work on one action point. If you     are shown list of 8 action points chances are you are going to  ignore the list.</span></span></span></li>
    <li><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: arial;"><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>Start of    Machine</strong> : This is the only time when my geeky brain still hasn't   taken the plunge towards coding. I have sometime to think and act   on.</span></span></span></li>
</ul>
<span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: arial;"><span style="font-size: small;">FlashCard is a simple application that will startup when the machine starts up. If you are connected to the internet it will read out the action point for you. Its a air application I have been using it on Windows. You can download it from  <a href="http://www.esnips.com/doc/3627e875-7cf3-4428-9a3b-ad3874ae2117/FlashCard"><a href="https://github.com/xebia/FlashCard">https://github.com/xebia/FlashCard</a></a> . Apart from the action points I have been adding a lot of todo also for me. Click on the <a href="http://xebee.xebia.in/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Flash_Card.swf">Flash_Card</a> to see how to use</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: arial;"><span style="font-size: small;">The idea of randomness really works for me as at any point in time <strong>you have to think of only one particular task to do</strong>.</span></span></span></p>
