# Better Work Management Using Bucket User Story

<p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 14px"><b><i>“Responding to change over following a plan” </i></b></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 14px">                                -       Manifesto for Agile Software Development</span><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 14px">Responding to change means accommodate changes (product backlog items) in the product backlog not in the sprint backlog after done with sprint planning.</span><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif">What if we need to accommodate some urgent tasks within the sprint? What if some tasks come up which directly don’t contribute for creating a potentially shippable product? What if there is some user stories which are not estimable in story points like training, research work, analysis etc.?</span><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif">Many thought leaders talk about these types of work and suggest some solutions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 14px">1) Ken Rubin, Principal Consultant at Innolution, LLC co-author of book "Succeeding with Objects: Decision Frameworks for Project Management” suggests to take buffer of team capacity says:</span><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 14px">“Keep in mind, that a team’s capacity for any given sprint should take into account planned time off, product backlog grooming, any training or work on other projects, and so on. <b>Don't forget to leave a reasonable buffer to address uncertainties</b>.”</span><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 14px">2) Create miscellaneous task swim mentioned by Mike Cohn, one of the contributors to the invention of the Scrum software development methodology, owner of Mountain Goat Software.</span><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 14px">“Create miscellaneous task swim lane in task board. The Miscellaneous row is essentially the storyless tasks. The Miscellaneous row holds things like “update the build server.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 14px">I do not normally recommend that a team estimate these items in story points such that they would earn any points toward velocity by completing these tasks. Tasks in the miscellaneous row are usually tasks that enable the team to perform the other work (or to perform it better or faster).”</span><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 14px">3) In the similar line, we Agile Coaches of Xebia India, use bucket story (Cheese block) to handle uncertainties.</span><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 14px">For managing these types of work we can create a separate story called <b>bucket story</b>. This story includes unplanned work, trainings, action items etc.</span><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 14px">While doing capacity planning for the team, we don’t need to commit full capacity for user stories. Some capacity can be reserved for the bucket story.</span></p>
<p><b style="line-height: 1.5em;font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif">What is a bucket Story?</b><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><b> </b></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif">Bucket Story is a simple user story, which team doesn’t need to estimate in user story points.  It’s a type of container with specific size / capacity to accommodate work up to available capacity. The work comes under bucket story doesn't contribute in velocity calculation.</span><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 14px">For an example: In a sprint of 2 week, team can reserve 30-40 hours (Team capacity, not specific to any team member, numbers mentioned are just for example purpose, team should decide as per their project work) in bucket story. Under this user story team can create multiple tasks like attending or delivering trainings, some unplanned work come up within the sprint. Estimate those tasks in ideal hours and accommodate tasks till available capacity (in hours).</span><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 14px">If unplanned work doesn’t come up, capacity remains available, team can pull next higher priority story from product backlog.</span><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"> </span></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 14px">Type of work that can be included in the bucket story</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 14px">1)   Story less tasks like update build server</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 14px">2)   Bugs discovered during the sprint but unrelated to the stories of current sprint</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 14px">3)   Attending or delivering trainings</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 14px">4)   Some unplanned work comes up which is required to achieve sprint goal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 14px">5)   Work that can’t be estimated in user story points.</span><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 14px"><b>Need of Bucket Story:</b></span><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"> </span></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 14px">Scenario:</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 14px">PO: Team could you please include configuration of new server urgently in current sprint. Server is required to be up because other team is dependent on us and delay will impact the business.</span><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 14px">Team: But we don’t have capacity in this sprint. Better push it to next sprint.</span><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 14px">Po: But it’s urgent. If you can stretch a bit and complete this as well.</span><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 14px">These types of scenarios are common in many teams. Though teams do continuous refinements, sometimes those scenarios come up within the sprint. To handle these situations bucket story is a good way.</span><b style="line-height: 1.5em;font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"> </b></p>
