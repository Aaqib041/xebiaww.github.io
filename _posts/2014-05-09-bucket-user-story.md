# Better Work Management Using Bucket User Story

**_“Responding to change over following a plan” _**

                                -       Manifesto for Agile Software Development 

Responding to change means accommodate changes (product backlog items) in the product backlog not in the sprint backlog after done with sprint planning. 

What if we need to accommodate some urgent tasks within the sprint? What if some tasks come up which directly don’t contribute for creating a potentially shippable product? What if there is some user stories which are not estimable in story points like training, research work, analysis etc.? 

Many thought leaders talk about these types of work and suggest some solutions.

1) Ken Rubin, Principal Consultant at Innolution, LLC co-author of book "Succeeding with Objects: Decision Frameworks for Project Management” suggests to take buffer of team capacity says: 

“Keep in mind, that a team’s capacity for any given sprint should take into account planned time off, product backlog grooming, any training or work on other projects, and so on. **Don't forget to leave a reasonable buffer to address uncertainties**.” 

2) Create miscellaneous task swim mentioned by Mike Cohn, one of the contributors to the invention of the Scrum software development methodology, owner of Mountain Goat Software. 

“Create miscellaneous task swim lane in task board. The Miscellaneous row is essentially the storyless tasks. The Miscellaneous row holds things like “update the build server.”

I do not normally recommend that a team estimate these items in story points such that they would earn any points toward velocity by completing these tasks. Tasks in the miscellaneous row are usually tasks that enable the team to perform the other work (or to perform it better or faster).” 

3) In the similar line, we Agile Coaches of Xebia India, use bucket story (Cheese block) to handle uncertainties. 

For managing these types of work we can create a separate story called **bucket story**. This story includes unplanned work, trainings, action items etc. 

While doing capacity planning for the team, we don’t need to commit full capacity for user stories. Some capacity can be reserved for the bucket story.

**What is a bucket Story?**** **

Bucket Story is a simple user story, which team doesn’t need to estimate in user story points.  It’s a type of container with specific size / capacity to accommodate work up to available capacity. The work comes under bucket story doesn't contribute in velocity calculation. 

For an example: In a sprint of 2 week, team can reserve 30-40 hours (Team capacity, not specific to any team member, numbers mentioned are just for example purpose, team should decide as per their project work) in bucket story. Under this user story team can create multiple tasks like attending or delivering trainings, some unplanned work come up within the sprint. Estimate those tasks in ideal hours and accommodate tasks till available capacity (in hours). 

If unplanned work doesn’t come up, capacity remains available, team can pull next higher priority story from product backlog. 

**Type of work that can be included in the bucket story**

1)   Story less tasks like update build server

2)   Bugs discovered during the sprint but unrelated to the stories of current sprint

3)   Attending or delivering trainings

4)   Some unplanned work comes up which is required to achieve sprint goal.

5)   Work that can’t be estimated in user story points. 

**Need of Bucket Story:** 

**Scenario:**

PO: Team could you please include configuration of new server urgently in current sprint. Server is required to be up because other team is dependent on us and delay will impact the business. 

Team: But we don’t have capacity in this sprint. Better push it to next sprint. 

Po: But it’s urgent. If you can stretch a bit and complete this as well. 

These types of scenarios are common in many teams. Though teams do continuous refinements, sometimes those scenarios come up within the sprint. To handle these situations bucket story is a good way.** **
