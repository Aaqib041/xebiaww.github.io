# Adding Value to Agile Retrospectives: Happiness Index

<p>Agile Retrospective is a way to improvement in agile teams. No Matters how good a scrum team is, there is always opportunity to improve. Scrum Masters constantly look for improvement opportunities but agile retrospective is the best platform to find some.</p>
<p>Many companies started using happiness index as part of retrospectives. Happiness Index is a technique to measure happiness of the agile teams. This exercise is mentioned in the book: “<b>Getting Value out of Agile Retrospectives</b>”, a book written by <b>Luis Gonçalves</b> and <b>Ben Linders</b>.</p>
<p>The purpose of this exercise is to draw a graphic representation of team members´ emotions during sprints, connecting their emotions to sprint events. With this kind of information, the team can identify what exactly affects its performance during the sprint.</p>
<p>ScrumInc used the happiness metric to help increase velocity over 500% in 2011." Net revenue doubled. The way to do this is now part of a formal pattern at <b>ScrumPlop.org</b> called "<b>Scrumming the Scrum.</b>" Travelling around the world, the happiness metric keeps bubbling up as a topic of interest."</p>
<p>I used the same happiness index exercise for one of my team. I created a survey on Google docs with simple questions.</p>
<p><a href="http://xebee.xebia.in/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/happiness-index.jpg"><img class="wp-image-17986 alignright" alt="happiness index" src="http://xebee.xebia.in/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/happiness-index.jpg" width="602" height="417" /></a></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5em">Making this survey shows better results. I added 2 subjective questions at the end.</span></p>
<p>1) What feels best right now?</p>
<p>2)  What would you want to change to increase your happiness?</p>
<p>From these questions we get to know about the best practices to continue and what needs to be improved in upcoming sprints. This survey takes only 5 mins to fill. If we do it in every sprint, it gives us a good way to apply kaizen. Google doc automatically shows the results in graph form.
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://xebee.xebia.in/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/happiness-index-1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-17987" alt="happiness index 1" src="http://xebee.xebia.in/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/happiness-index-1.jpg" width="414" height="371" /></a></p>
We can use some tools like <a href="https://www.happinessmetric.com/">https://www.happinessmetric.com/</a> and TinyPulse etc to create the happiness index survey forms and automatically generating the reports.</p>
<p>Happiness index affect the happiness of employees directly. Agile emphasizes teamwork in software development and recognizes its human aspect. Delivering innovative, high quality software at a steady pace requires motivated, involved and happy teams. Happiness index brings positivity in the organization and a way of continuous improvement.</p>
