# Adding Value to Agile Retrospectives: Happiness Index

Agile Retrospective is a way to improvement in agile teams. No Matters how good a scrum team is, there is always opportunity to improve. Scrum Masters constantly look for improvement opportunities but agile retrospective is the best platform to find some. Many companies started using happiness index as part of retrospectives. Happiness Index is a technique to measure happiness of the agile teams. This exercise is mentioned in the book: “**Getting Value out of Agile Retrospectives**”, a book written by **Luis Gonçalves** and **Ben Linders**. The purpose of this exercise is to draw a graphic representation of team members´ emotions during sprints, connecting their emotions to sprint events. With this kind of information, the team can identify what exactly affects its performance during the sprint. ScrumInc used the happiness metric to help increase velocity over 500% in 2011." Net revenue doubled. The way to do this is now part of a formal pattern at **ScrumPlop.org** called "**Scrumming the Scrum.**" Travelling around the world, the happiness metric keeps bubbling up as a topic of interest." I used the same happiness index exercise for one of my team. I created a survey on Google docs with simple questions. ![happiness index](/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/happiness-index.jpg) Making this survey shows better results. I added 2 subjective questions at the end. 1) What feels best right now? 2)  What would you want to change to increase your happiness? From these questions we get to know about the best practices to continue and what needs to be improved in upcoming sprints. This survey takes only 5 mins to fill. If we do it in every sprint, it gives us a good way to apply kaizen. Google doc automatically shows the results in graph form.

We can use some tools like <https://www.happinessmetric.com/> and TinyPulse etc to create the happiness index survey forms and automatically generating the reports. Happiness index affect the happiness of employees directly. Agile emphasizes teamwork in software development and recognizes its human aspect. Delivering innovative, high quality software at a steady pace requires motivated, involved and happy teams. Happiness index brings positivity in the organization and a way of continuous improvement.
