# Heuristic Evaluation

<p>Couple of days back I went to meet my Uncle who owns a Jewelry Showroom. He asked me to give feedback on his website which was build two years back. This is very normal with any IT person and</p>
<p>I am sure you must have face such kind of situations with your friends and relatives. They expect some expert view on the product they have.</p>
<p>But my question is  do you really think one can thoroughly do heuristic evaluation on the spot.  My answer would be "No", I can't give certain assumption by just doing quick evaluation without understanding business goals and strategy. I need to understand who the end users are and what is their expectations while browsing this site.<!--more--></p>
<p>What is a heuristic evaluation?
<ul>
    <li>It is based on certain rules of thumb</li>
    <li>The best practices which are perfumed on study and survey based</li>
    <li>Intuitive judgments after doing many research keeping user shoes in yours</li>
    <li>User experience common sense based on who the user are and how they are going to use it</li>
    <li>Compliance with recognized usability principles</li>
</ul>
According to me heuristic evaluation for the Jeweler or any e-commerce site is to evaluate the strength and quality of what is currently offered and user is able to quickly find and purchase products. For the seller it is to quickly process online purchases without any hassle for user and make a profit.</p>
<p><b>Most critical success of online store is the ease of use for the user to navigate each sections without any can of worms. Each categories, sub category and user pages, enrollment pages, shopping cart pages which includes payment and shipping, all these pages should be easy to access at any point of shopping.</b></p>
<p>I follow following principles while doing heuristic evaluation.
<ul>
    <li><b>Findable</b>:- The ability for the user to easily locate what he is looking for. User come with some expectation, with a mental model and with past experience. Make sure everything is easily finable and approachable for him, like simple navigation and common terms make it more easy to find what he is looking for. Also make sure this work for all different channels and devices you build for.</li>
    <li><b>Easily recognizable</b>:- Use of right words to demonstrate the message, don't make it more complicate by using pictures which has no relevance with the product or has double meaning. Try to convey your message clear and without any distraction to understand. Using portraits of people will definitely draw reader's attention, especially if the images are relevant and tell a story of the product.</li>
    <li><b>Communicative</b>:- The message should be easy to understand and very powerful for user to complete the tasks. Be precise while showing major headings which are clear &amp; descriptive, alerts which are easy to understand, errors guide them what to do next, messages help them to take further decision. When a piece of communication is relevant, worthwhile and compelling, it moves user to take action, and if the message is not clear and easy to understand it takes just few second for user to get frustrate and leave your site.</li>
    <li><b>Efficiency of use</b>:- Is the website easy to use with maximum efficiency, memorable and learn-able experience. Use of appropriate component design, help the task make it worth, simple, useful and innovative for user. Features offered to allow the user to tailor information or functionality to their context, like slider (track bar), iphone "on/off" toggle buttons.</li>
    <li><b>Reliability</b>:- Worth of confidence for user to trust and build relationship with seller, check if:-
<ul>
    <li>The content is timely updated</li>
    <li>Achieve is maintained every month/yearly</li>
    <li>Live chat facility and Help desk numbers to contact</li>
    <li>Trusted third-party certification and affiliations, e.g. TRUSTe, VeriSign etc</li>
    <li>Quick Response (QR) codes give Smartphone users</li>
</ul>
</li>
    <li><b>Error free</b>:- How well are errors anticipated and eliminated? How easily can a user recover and exits from important controls clearly marked. How user can complete tasks without making errors</li>
    <li><b>Accessible and effectiveness</b>:- User can achieve what they need by using the product. Site should be design keeping in people with disabilities can also excess it.</li>
    <li><b>Ease of learning</b>:- For a novice user it should not be a new world, he can grasp it quickly. Design the interface in such a way he can learn on first go. Make it intuitive for him to use it and enjoy while surfing.</li>
    <li><b>Memorable and Satisfaction</b>:- For the return user the website should be remember able and reusable interface effectively.</li>
    <li><b>Valuable</b>:- Is product desirable to the target user, which can be done by showing product pictures, customer testimonials.</li>
    <li><b>Consistency and standards:-
</b>Site should have consistent look n feel of all headings, pages, layout grid , colors should have same meaning. Buttons having affordance look and not look like flat tire. Links are consistent &amp; easy to identify by having different color and if possible underline which make user easy to understand. User has mental model, clicking on logo from internal pages of website takes user to home page.</li>
</ul>
Keeping above mentioned points I do my practice on heuristic evaluation of product and it really help me to give better result.</p>
