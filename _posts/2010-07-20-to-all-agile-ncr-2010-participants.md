# To All Agile NCR 2010 Participants

<p>Dear All,</p>
<p>A turnout of close to 300 people on a hot and humid weekend in Gurgaon for the annual event on Agile software development, Agile NCR 2010, was a clear signal about the growing interest in Agile, SCRUM and XP in India. Agile practitioners from all over the India interacted with people from software industry that included roles such as project managers, teachers, students, developers and testers, at Ansal Institute of Technology located in Gurgaon.</p>
<p><strong>Parallel Tracks</strong></p>
<p>We have divided the whole event in four tracks to cover the needs of individuals who find themselves in different stages of Agile adoption which was appreciated by most people. Another remarkable point was a diverse selection of speakers from the companies of all sizes though the agenda was mainly dominated by the folks from Xebia and Thoughtworks who are among the early adopters of Agile.</p>

<p>When I set up Agile NCR platform in 2006, I never expected that this event would grow so much in size but similarly when Xebia first adopted Agile in 2003, we never expected Agile to become a software movement on the lines similar to the open source movement, in the world in just 7 years.

<p>Rapid growth of offshore IT industry and the associated economics have forced Agile community to look at the collaboration of geographically distributed teams which is very important in the context of India. We see a convergence of the best practices when executing a distributed project which was beautifully described by Rini van Solingen over the phone line from Holland. Ironically technical problems in setting up good quality Skype video connection also exposed the limitations imposed by the poor internet connectivity on distributed collaboration.</p>

<p><strong>Distributed Agile</strong></p>
<p>At Xebia, distributed Agile is close to our hearts.  We started our first serious distributed Agile project with India and The Netherlands team for our customer Dutch Railway in 2007. Around the same time, Gurgaon Metro construction had begun  few yards away from our Millennium Plaza office.  As the metro construction progressed so did this project. The last distributed team in India finished working on this project in 2009 i.e. just a year before the Metro begun running between Delhi and Gurgaon.</p>
<p>This project was very significant because  it was a failing project before we took it over and re-did it with Distributed Agile teams located in India and The Netherlands. During the course of this project, several times I interacted with Jeff Sutherland (Co-Creator of Scrum) who observed the growing productivity and the quality of our work with indifference, as for him this was an expected outcome of Scrum implemented the right way. The <a href="http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Distributed-Scrum-Sutherland-Schoonheim">success of this project</a> has been presented in the IEEE publications and Agile conferences in North America and Europe. The book “<em>Succeeding with Agile</em>” by Mike Cohn that you have got free during Agile NCR 2010<em> (Courtsey: Pete Deemer, GoodAgile)</em>, mentions about this project on page 368.</p>
<p><strong>Do and Learn</strong></p>
<p>We do, we learn, we give leanings back to the community for further refinement. This is the central idea behind Agile NCR platform. Since past 4 years, we had opportunity to host the Thought Leaders such as Poppendiecks, Venkat and Michael Feathers and top Agile consultants such as Sanjiv Augustine and Nilay Oza for our community events. If you missed those events then this is the good time to get involved.</p>
<p><strong>Win a Free CSM Training</strong></p>
<p>Sanjiv will be visiting New Delhi region to conduct a CSM training in August.<strong> Xebia will give away a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">free CSM seat</span> to a person who publishes the best blog about Agile NCR on any site,  in this <a href="http://xebia.wordpress.com/2010/06/23/certified-scrummaster-training-19-20-august-gurgaon-india/">upcoming CSM training</a> (Last date of submission is 10<sup>th</sup> August and we expect at least 8 published blogs to select from to choose the winner or else no winner). </strong>Xebia is also trying to make CSM trainings <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">more affordable in India by</span></strong> offering special discounts to Agile NCR participants. You will see a new pricing soon.</p>
<p>The real success of Agile NCR will be determined by the agile adoptions in India. Please keep documenting and sharing you learning and experience so that we all know if Agile has helped you do your project better.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>

**[Anurag Shrivastava](#94 "2010-08-17 11:11:02"):** Hi All, We have decided to drop the best Agile NCR blogger contest and a free CSM training seat for the best blogger. Unfortunately we have not seen the minimum 8 blog post that were required for this competition to take place. Though we are not happy to announce the cancellation, we promise to have this contest again in 2011 and then we hope to see more blogs and tweets on Agile NCR. Regards, Anurag http:\\\www.xebiaindia.com htpp:\\\xebee.xebia.in
