# 3 X 3 reasons why you need user stories for product requirements

<p>Using user stories is a quick and effective way of handling customer requirements. Mostly used with agile software development methodologies, user stories facilitate requirements management. User story captures the 'who', 'what' and 'why' of a requirement in a simple and concise way. Capturing requirements of a product is one of the primary tasks of a product owner. Hence, here I try to list down the benefits user stories provide on using them for requirements discovery.

</strong></p>
<p><strong>Communication enabler</strong></p>
<p>Answers<strong> why</strong>: Probably the most important benefit of all, user stories represent the value that we are trying to deliver.
Emphasizes <strong>verbal communications</strong>: User stories promote refined and frequent conversations(developer with customer), over perfect requirements.
More <strong>comprehensible</strong>: Balances well between technical and domain language, facilitating easy comprehensibility for both customers and developers. Not to forget stories are easier to recall.
<ul></ul>
<strong>Process supporter</strong></p>
<p>Fit for <strong>iterative development</strong>: There is no need to write all stories upfront. This acknowledges the fact that all requirements are not known upfront.
Encourages <strong>deferred detail</strong>: Stories can be detailed as an when required. To begin with stories be just a goal holder, and then later few of them can be detailed to start work upon. Key aspects of the conversation are later recorded on the user story or supplemental documents.
Supports <strong>opportunistic development</strong>: Stories allow the team to shift between low level and high level thinking and conversations about requirements.
<ul></ul>
<strong>Knowledge builder</strong></p>
<p>Builds up <strong>tacit knowledge</strong>: Frequent conversations between team members and customers, and also among customers, helps in building more knowledge within the team.
Encourages <strong>participatory design</strong>: Stories shift the focus from system attributes to the user goals, and this leads to more interesting discussions on the system
Acts as knowledge <strong>facilitator</strong>: User story facilitates knowledge sharing between the two knowledge group of customers and the technical know-how. It provides the knowledge about the customers and the context.
<ul></ul>
However, the key thing to realize, as said by Ron Jeffries is that "User stories themselves are not requirements, they are placeholders for conversations", meaning after user stories, requirements are yet to be discovered through conversations.</p>
