# Emerging Paradigms in Agile Testing

We all know that the landscape of software quality is getting changed significantly primarily because of 3 reasons viz. the need to go faster to the market, need to add/deliver/optimize value for customer in every delivery that we make and to cut the costs. However many pillars of successful quality strategies of the past are slowing down delivery too much. To be competitive in the future, we have to completely change the way we measure, assure and define quality. Today we need fast feedback and greater visibility, and increasing coordination and collaboration on Agile projects make that possible.

Before we discuss existing and new paradigms, first of all lets discuss why we need new paradigms in agile testing? 

Gone are the days when you trust that CEO of your company is going to figure out how to raise the money or CTO is going to pick the right technology stack or VP of Marketing and sales is going to put together a great pitch to get new business. To win a new client and new business we need to show our prospects how we develop software and how we check project deliverable (manual and automation testing), CI, exploratory testing etc. For all these we need new paradigms.

So lets dive in the pool of some of existing and emerging paradigms of Agile Testing:

**1) Effective Requirements Gathering** Why? Who? How? What?

Today's agile tester knows that silence is not going to inspire confidence and it is all about intense questioning. Slogan of Question…question…question…and deliver value..value..value..is not incorrect.

_Why?_ This is the most important question. Why are we doing this? This is the goal we are trying to achieve.

_Who?_ Who are the users of our product? Who will be impacted by it?

_How?_ How should our user's behaviour change? These are the impacts that we're trying to create.

_What?_ Once we have the first three questions answered, we can talk about scope. What can we do, as an organisation or a delivery team, to support the required impacts? These are the deliverables & software features.

Please take notice that just giving info about ‘what’ and ‘how’ is not enough to make projects successful. These things do not prepare teams for reacting to unforeseen problems. Explaining ‘why’ and ‘watch out for’ is much more imp.

**2) "Begin with the End in Mind" - TDD**

The main benefit of using TDD is, it makes you think about what you're about to write, before you write it. In order to write the tests you need to know what methods/functions you're going to need, what will those methods receive as an input and what they should return. Usually the final outcome is better, more expressive and well structured code.

**3) Sensitize & Prevent, not Design & Execute**

Testers are bearers of good news now. Mindset has got changed from “How can I break this software?” to “How can I help the team deliver really good software?”  Testers are uncovering serious flaws, not in the code but 'would be' code. Testers do deep questioning to understand deep stuff.

**4) Agile cannot exist without Test Automation**

Test automation is a crucial aspect of fast feedback. Agile teams must deliver production-ready software every four, two, or one-week iteration – or possibly many times every day! This goal can’t be achieved without automated tests.

The rapid delivery cycles under agile make software to automate testing a necessity to keep the quality of the product and the code from slipping. The cost of adopting automated testing and the hassle in changing ways of working to accommodate it can seem more bother than they’re worth. But failing to introduce automated testing makes it tricky for manual testing teams to keep on top of bugs during the short delivery times for each iteration of the software - particularly as the overall code grows in size.

**5) Peripheral / Exploratory Testing**

This type of testing is beyond “checking” and for this we need to use the most important testing tool at our disposal: the one between our ears. It has advantage over the computer as we are Sapient!

Traditional testing models rely on the straightforward approach of checking a system against expectations. This form of testing is essential, but it also suffers from a major blind spot: What if the system does something we don't expect? That's where exploratory testing comes in. QA is having advantage over the computer, QA person is Sapient!

Even though creating huge amount of automated checks that will be executed every time code is integrated is an appealing thought it is not enough to cover the whole spectrum of testing. This is where we testers can contribute with lots of value. We are set out to find new information about the software by exploration and learning. We can easier relate and adapt to users and the business objectives of the product.

**6) Testers as valued agile team members having truly _'Independent'_ Status**

It used to be very common for companies to expect their testers to hold themselves aloof from what the programmers were doing. This was mainly due to belief that too-close collaboration between testers and developers would somehow compromise tester's independence. To foster test independence, those organizations removed their testers from the programmers’ sphere of influence, giving them a reporting stream of their own.

At that time, creating this sort of independence seemed like a good idea. Some of the benefits of this approach were realized, but those benefits were frequently outweighed by the negative unintended consequences. Sometimes the tester’s information could delay a release and cause problems for management. And sometimes, not listening to that information results in bigger and more expensive problems. So tester independence is a state of mind—one that every healthy software development culture encourages and nurtures.

**7) If you are not getting better you are getting worse**

New skills & techniques like mind mapping and speed reading are coming up in modern testing age. Let's not be agile for just the sake of agile. There is renewed focus on face-to-face communication, debating etc. If you are not getting better you are getting worse. Therefore people have started leveraging Blogs, Forums, Conferences, Meetups, Online training to keep themselves up to date.

Knowledge helps to adapt to the changing contexts of short iterations. Knowing your testing mission helps every tester to decide what to test, and what explicitly not to test - right now.  Similarly there are few testers who know how to support their team and we all know that the skills necessary to bring the development team to new insights and tackle their unknowns is crucial in a fast-paced environment.

**8 ) Continuous Delivery Nirvana**

One of the benefits from frequent deployments is ever-improving feedback. Nowadays first thing that client looks for might be whether you can deploy repeatedly as this is the best measure of how frequently you release and continue to release.

There is nothing important than getting feedback of your work from the tests you have written and from your users after you have deployed the code on production servers. Continuous integration takes the idea of running tests regularly and every time that you save to the code repository as part of your integration process. It is about pushing the test automation even nearer to the point of code creation. Testing occurs at every integration.

**9) Cloud Enhances Agile Software Testing**

While the degree of business agility of today's organization may be different there are few metrics that can be referred: Time to market, Issues Responsiveness and flexibility. Cloud computing is helping these organizations to align their development projects with business goals. How?
