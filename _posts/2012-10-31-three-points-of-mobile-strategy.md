<p>Mobile development/designing strategy could be totally different,  depending on the above requirements. If you are planning to have a mobile presence (app or website) and don’t have any idea,  here are few steps should be considered before the start.</p>
<p><strong>Gauge your users:</strong></p>
<p>Understanding how mobile traffic is consuming content is crucial. You need to monitor traffic pattern and  user’s behavior on different devices before spending resources on development. You can take various factors into considerations:
<ul>
    <li>When any user visit company’ website on mobile, what most relevant information he will be seeking?</li>
    <li> Are they frequent buyer or using website for social networking?</li>
    <li> Are users tech savvy or business managers or normal users who don't have expensive phones.  If target users are tech savvy then you would probably create an app (iPhone or android); if they are business managers, opt for Blackberry app; if your audience doesn't have any specific category then go with device independent responsive websites.</li>
    <li> From which device the traffic is coming? Yes, you can monitor the device through various analytical software available in the market like Google analytics, KISSmatrics. If you are developing an application from scratch, you need to overhaul content, navigation and other information as per mobile. Analyzing device and browsers at beginning as per target users and create a solution around them minimize risk of failure.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Content strategy-Desktop vers Mobile:</strong></p>
<p>Data consumption on desktop is higher than mobile. On mobile, users want quick and easy access to  information; they would not need lots of information on the go. Planning of content strategy should be in the context of mobile usages. Ask “What content should be available on mobile?” “What value does it add to customer’ lives from a mobile perspective?” for example creating a ditto copy of website with lengthy articles doesn't make any sense. Restructuring the articles in a condensed way might be a solution. When porting desktop site to mobile, you also need to convert “hovers”, “double clicks” to “taps. Re-structuring of navigation, use of images,  positioning of CTA (Call to action) and Single column layout with collapsible navigation works best for mobile due to the limited view port.

<p><strong>Testing, testing and more testing:</strong></p>
<p>Testing of the mobile site or app should be start from the early stage not after development. Early testing of user’s behavior through questionnaires, interviews and  A/B testing on design prototype help validating requirements to increase conversion rate. After that testing of page load or speed also help to reduce bounce rate; user generally moves out after 4 seconds if the page takes lots of time in loading. File download, display of video or images, accessibility  and readability of PDFs or any third party software,  interaction with forms or lead generating cues should be tested thoroughly before launching.</p>
<p>It is always recommended to test application on real devices; but in case of the absence of smart phones various online emulators, bowers extensions are available.</p>
<p>Here is the list of browser extensions:</p>
