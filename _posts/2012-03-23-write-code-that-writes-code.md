# Write Code that writes code

<p>We never like to write a boiler plate code.It makes programming too boring. If we have to write a boiler plate code that might be a flaw in the design. Somehow the above assumption is not good. A lot of times when you are architecting a solution where there is  a distributed team of 20-30 people you have to follow a particular design in writing the code that others understand. Sometimes frameworks might not give you a option to design the application such that there is no boiler plate code.<!--more-->

<br/>
<div>Templating is a  parital solution of problem. Ofcourse now you need to create good templates. Finding the right template solution and integrated in your system is the perfect solution to this boiler plate code problem. Please have a look at the below video which show how we solve this problem for us.</div></p>
<p><object width="640" height="360"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/Jgiv7YfXRcU?version=3&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0&amp;fmt=22"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/Jgiv7YfXRcU?version=3&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0&amp;fmt=22" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="640" height="360" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></p>
<p>As you saw , just as you create a simple class using new class , you can also generate the boiler plate code without much problem and make your life much simpler. Over the period of time refactoring can help in creating more abstraction and generating more code that can help.Enjoy!!!</p>
<p>Please find the source <a href='http://xebee.xebia.in/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/ParsleyCodeGenerator.zip'>ParsleyCodeGenerator</a> for generating the parsely code with templates. Compiling the above air application in Flash Builder will result in installer that can be installed on your machine. Once installed use <a href='http://www.vogella.com/articles/EclipsePlugIn/article.html#contribute_packageexplorer'>Eclipse Plugin</a>
blog to create a simple plugin that will invoke Parsley Code Generator.</p>
