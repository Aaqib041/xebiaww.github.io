#   Importance of Retrospective in Agile - Tester’s perspective

There are lots of steps in Agile methodology for developing a software. The one testing team didn’t pay attention to was **Retrospective** and this caused the product not being tested the way it was expected till penultimate sprint. 

This may sound strange but then if agile methodology (or any other methodology for that matter) is not followed the way it should be, then end result cannot be good.

We were close to disaster, then somebody suggested having a retrospective and this worked wonders for the project. We were able to get hold of all issues within the team which team members suffered and jostled with but would never speak about them in open or to management.

This experience made me think that I should write about the importance of Retrospective in agile.

Let’s start with what is Retrospective in general sense: Dictionary meaning is:** Retrospective** (from [Latin][1] _retrospectare_, "look back") generally means to take a look back at events that already have taken place. For example, the term is used in [medicine][2], describing a look back at a patient's [medical history][3] or [lifestyle][4].

In Software development and testing as well, it means looking back at the work done in the Sprints and trying to find out the following (the list below is can be amended; **idea is to get hold of misunderstandings** **and issues from the Team which are hampering work**):

A)     What went well?

B)     What didn’t go so well?

C)     What can be made better and how?

D)     Any personal or professional issues which team members face can be brought to the table and rectified.

**A)     ****What went well?**

**Team should discuss what situations and process worked for them in this sprint and thus can use them for betterment of the software product.**

1)      Eg: Testing tools used served the purpose, prior experience of resources was kept in mind while choosing them.( hence saved time which would have been used in learning them )

**       B) What didn’t go well?**

**       Team should discuss what process and situations didn’t work for them in this sprint and thus avoid these in future.**

**1)     ****Eg: Too much work for the sprint was allocated because of unrealistic deadline in the first place for project completion. ( testers should be made part of estimate process and preferably same tester should work on the estimated projects )**

2)      **Eg: Development went on till last minute and tester didn’t had enough time to test. **(Though major functionalities were tested, but negative testing like entering numerals in mobile number field was not done. **Time should always be given to testers because they are last line of defence**.)

3)      Eg: Team sat too close and thus testers and developers became friends. Testers sat alongside developers and for first time were seen accommodating things that should not have been, like developers getting irritated when defects were raised and testers turning blind eye to few defects. ( all defects should be logged, sitting close together may not be beneficial always , just my personal experience or tester has to **be more diplomatic **in terms of being polite with developers and at the same time raising bugs and not overlooking them at all )

4)      Eg: Choosing Open source tools with limited support caused longer learning curve. ( though **open source tools gave good ROI **once they are known completely )

**     C) What can be made better and how?**

**Team should discuss process and situation that can be made better.**

1)  Eg: **Testers should work closely but not sit close to developers**. (Aim is to deliver best product but testers and developers need there spaces to work and being Agile, distributed teams should not hamper project work.)( or testers should learn diplomacy )

2)  Eg: Moving to time tested paid tools with less learning curve should get implemented.( or testers should learn open source with better ROI but they always somehow have limited support)

3) Eg: Always informing the client **before** **accepting the change requests about the kind of rework which may be required.**

**D)     ****Any issues personal or professional can be brought to the table.**

**Team should discuss issues which might be hampering there project work.**

**  **     1)  Eg: Issues like team not sure what are the expectations from them. (Trust me this happens)

2) Eg: How to handle change requests by the client.

3) Eg: More resources required for the project to complete within deadline.

Thus in my experience, **Retrospective can really give insight into how well sprint went and what are the reasons for not being it on track. **Team members when prompted as part of the process will try to resolve all personal or professional issues and thus work together for the betterment of the project** and **will not assume that management is aware of their situation. (Like we assumed that everyone is aware of the unrealistic deadline and thus didn’t tell about it).

** **Better situation would have been, **conducting Retrospective after every sprint** and thus making management aware of the need of **more resources, time, and help in handling change requests** to complete the testing of the project in a better and confident manner.

This particular project though ended on a great note with client appreciation and more work, thanks to retro.
