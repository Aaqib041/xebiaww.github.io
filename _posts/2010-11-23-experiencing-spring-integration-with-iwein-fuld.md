# Experiencing Spring Integration with Iwein Fuld

<h4>Place : Xebia India, gurgaon</h4>

<h4>Day 1: 17 Nov, 2010</h4>

<p>This morning, I was going to attend Spring Integration training by no other than the guru himself, Iwein Fuld. I was definitely excited. I entered the training location to find close to 15 people in the room, we were supposed to sit in groups of 5. We made 3 groups and got seated.</p>

<p>Iwein first took us over through the concepts of Spring Integration and how they could be used to implement a messaging system in multiple independent applications to integrate them together. It was an engaging power point presentation in which he beautifully used pictorial description for explaining the concepts. Check it out <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/iweinfuld/spring-integration-motivation-and-history-5020632">here</a>. And yes I now know how 'coffee' is related to 'Spring Integration'. The way these things were explained, everything simply sunk into my brain.</p>
<p>But if it had to be just the presentation, I would'nt have probably taken the pain to write down my experience on paper. After the basic concepts were explained to us, we were told to find out the answer to one question (and yes, we had access to the internet!  :-)  ) while Iwein grabbed a cup of coffee. Everyone quickly googled <strong>"What is Peer Instruction?"</strong> and got to know the methodology that was to be used in the rest of the session. Iwein has already put up a blog about this methodology used in the training <a href="http://iweinfuld.posterous.com/">here</a>.</p>
<p>The rest of the training was done through the medium of a case, we had a skeleton of an application ready and we were to build 3 functionalities around it.

    <li>File Reading</li>
    <li>Twitter Integration</li>
    <li>Email Integration</li>
</ol>
These were divided into small user stories and we followed scrum. We used Git for the version control so I got my hands on some 'Git' too! At the end of day one, we could finish few small user stories.
<h4>Day 2: 18th Nov, 2010</h4>
We assembeled in the hall and in the same groups as day 1 and continued on the user stories. We wrote unit tests for our code, made sure we have the right design in place, and also thought about performance. Iwein also made code review comments whereever he felt something was not perfect. This day we focussed on software craftsmanship along with learning Spring Integration.</p>
<p>I must mention the way Peer Instruction was used, it made the training much more engaging and fun. Also the fact that the training provided with hands-on through a realistic case and that the focus was more on getting the concepts right instead of running through the whole API is really commendable. If we could focus a little bit more on the theoritical concepts and prepared the best solutions before hand it would be what we call a 'Perfect Training'.</p>
<p>Over all for me, it was a great learning experience. I thoroughly enjoyed it.</p>
<p>Cheers!</p>
