# Anatomy of an ISV

A most venerable service provided by Indian software companies to the overseas market, is a product engineering services. It is so, because targeting global ISVs for product engineering services does not require much vertical knowledge as compared to the End User Companies (which uses the software for itself). So it is imperative to understand the characteristics of an Independent Software Vendors (ISV). **ISVs can be classified on the basis of:**

  1. Vertical/Domain – mostly ISVs are domain experts like in finance, logistics, insurance, telecom etc.
  2. Product Life Cycle Stage – a product could be at introduction, growth, maturity or declining stage and this classification is very critical, because products at different stages have different set of challenges.
  3. Technology – can be classified on the basis of technologies used, in the development of their products like java, .net etc. It has been observed that ISVs stick to a particular technology for lack of alternative technological support.
  4. Portfolio of products- an ISV can have one or multiple products; this signifies the maturity and expertness of any ISV.
  5. Geography – an ISV target markets can be US, Europe, Australia etc and every market have different culture and set of challenges.
  6. Size of the company – it can also be differentiated, on the basis of startup or a well established company.
**Challenges of an ISV:**

  1. Budget Constraint (cost and predictability) – mainly with startups and small size companies.
  2. Time to market (schedule slippage) – reduced time to market is always welcomed.
  3. Availability of skills with respect to the technology.
  4. Resource scalability issues (Ramp up and scale down in future). – holding idle resources involve high cost.
  5. More concerned about information security (IPR) issues – for an ISV the product is their asset, so theft of code is a fear factor for them.
  6. Identifying right technology – as they are more expert on domain not on technologies, they find tough to identify appropriate technology for their new or existing products.
  7. Market research (Identify and develop target markets) – sounds not a cup of tea of a software companies, but TCS does that for their clients as a value addition.
  8. Competition – with existing players, new entrants and substitute products with better functionalities.
  9. Quality – always a matter of concern.
  10. Winning customer confidence and satisfaction.
  11. Maintenance and support to their products – as it is high bandwidth mundane work and with less risk involved.
  12. Vendor identification – finds difficult to identify right vendor for outsourcing or partnerships.
It might sound very basic to you, but basics are most likely to forget. Every prospect ISV has different set of challenges on the basis of their classification, so needs to be pitched accordingly. For example a startup ISV with new product can have budget problem or predictability of the cost problem but, a well established ISV coming up with second or third product will have less issues pertaining to budget and predictability, however maintenance and support could be an area of concern for them. To overcome most of these challenges ISVs has the best solution, to go for a good offshore outsourcing partnership.
