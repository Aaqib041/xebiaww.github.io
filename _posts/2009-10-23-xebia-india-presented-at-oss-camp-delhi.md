# Xebia India Presented at OSS Camp, Delhi

[Xebia](http://www.xebiaindia.com) has been acively working on, with and endorsing open source software. Recently, Xebia India presented at the [OSS Camp, New Delhi](http://osscamp.in/event/osscamp-delhi-september-2009). OSS Camp is claimed as community driven conferences to promote FOSS in India. Xebia had two presentations at the camp 1\. [Getting started with Scala](http://osscamp.in/talk/getting-started-scala) \- Vikas Hazrati and Meetu Maltiar 2\. [Rules with Drools](http://osscamp.in/talk/rules-drools) \- Gaurav Kohli and Saket Vishal Overall the ambience was good with some excited technologists from the audience engaging with the speakers and making the presentation fun and interactive. Luckily a lot of people could connect with the Scala presentation and the organisers decided to [run a blog competition on the Scala presentation](http://osscamp.in/blog/osscamp-delhi-september-2009-aftermath-blogging-contest). The video and slides of the presentation are embedded.
