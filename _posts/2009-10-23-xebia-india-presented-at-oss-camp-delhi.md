# Xebia India Presented at OSS Camp, Delhi

[Xebia][1] has been acively working on, with and endorsing open source software. Recently, Xebia India presented at the [OSS Camp, New Delhi][2]. OSS Camp is claimed as community driven conferences to promote FOSS in India.

Xebia had two presentations at the camp

  1. [Getting started with Scala][3] \- Vikas Hazrati and Meetu Maltiar

  2. [Rules with Drools][4] \- Gaurav Kohli and Saket Vishal

Overall the ambience was good with some excited technologists from the audience engaging with the speakers and making the presentation fun and interactive. Luckily a lot of people could connect with the Scala presentation and the organisers decided to [run a blog competition on the Scala presentation][5].

The video and slides of the presentation are embedded.
