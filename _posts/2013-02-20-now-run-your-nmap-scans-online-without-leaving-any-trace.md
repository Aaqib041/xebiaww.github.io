# Now Run your Nmap Scans Online without leaving any Trace

" Many of us who use Nmap to scan and protect our networks know the power of Nmap. Since the beginning of scanning, we have always considered Nmap as the best Scanning tool ever made for penetration testers, Security researchers and hackers. "  said Nmap author Fyodor Vaskovich at Blackhat. Primarily Nmap is a Desktop Tool  but  Now a website has provided a full-fledged Online NMAP service (** we are not disclosing the name of Website as per the ethical standards of reporting), all you need to do is to log on to the website and simply provide the IP address / website name of a target you want to SCAN. This online scanning service will then run a free and super-fast scan for you on your target.

 **The Service intends to provide a fast and easy online Nmap based port scanner to test your own servers, firewalls and networks and has several unique Features: **

  * You can schedule your network scans as per your requirements like a daily, weekly or Monthly Scan. The reports are automatically saved.
  * You can even compare results with your previous scan history.
  * The service has the collection of latest Nmap scripts and ensures that the scans are always running on the latest versions thus relieving you of the headache of Script searching and collection and then keep on looking for latest ones every now and then.
  * It provides you a Real world view of See what your external network looks like from a hacker's perspective and has Professional tool suite helps you assess risks and vulnerabilities, as well as suggested action.
  * You can even run Run vulnerability checks, pen tests, password cracks, and more.
  * The services provides very Informative and Graphic, data-rich reports and alert you to important changes in your network.

**Now let’s have a look how this service can be exploited by Hackers!**

  * As per India's Information Technology Act and other laws worldwide, Using any tool to Scan a website to find open ports, OS Detection,  enumerating system details or installed services versions is completely illegal and get you banned by your ISP, sued by Website  and even fined and jailed for scanning a target under hacking attempt.
  * Normally a Person who has scanned any target is tracked back via his IP address from where he has performed the scanning. Now imagine what mayhem will be created if a person is able to run a full-fledged Nmap Scan on a website without leaving any Trace of his IP.
  * Since the entire scanning service is provided online on website, user does not have to install anything even remotely related to Nmap. So there will be no trace or finger print of Nmap being ever used or installed on attacker's machine.
  * Though the service may claim to be recording the user's IP address but any wise attacker will use a Proxy to access the website providing this service as it will not affect the scanning speed anyways as the scanner would run from site's server.
  * The Service can be accessed by Botnets. The Bot Master may be using his bots to run the scans from victim’s machines without the victim ever knowing it.

 Though this service which is intended to be professional service to secure One’s own Networks It is been widely abused by miscreants and has simply turned into a free scan party for Hackers. Though the concerns are being raised and pressure is building on website to switch off free scans But history has always proven, an Idea can never be killed. Cheers!!!!
