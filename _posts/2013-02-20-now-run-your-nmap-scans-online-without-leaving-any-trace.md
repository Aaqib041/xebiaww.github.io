# Now Run your Nmap Scans Online without leaving any Trace

Primarily Nmap is a Desktop Tool  but  Now a website has provided a full-fledged Online NMAP service (** we are not disclosing the name of Website as per the ethical standards of reporting), all you need to do is to log on to the website and simply provide the IP address / website name of a target you want to SCAN. This online scanning service will then run a free and super-fast scan for you on your target.</p>

<p><b>      </b></p>
<p><b>Now let’s have a look how this service can be exploited by Hackers!</b>
<ul>
    <li style="text-align: justify;">As per India's Information Technology Act and other laws worldwide, Using any tool to Scan a website to find open ports, OS Detection,  enumerating system details or installed services versions is completely illegal and get you banned by your ISP, sued by Website  and even fined and jailed for scanning a target under hacking attempt.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li style="text-align: justify;">Normally a Person who has scanned any target is tracked back via his IP address from where he has performed the scanning. Now imagine what mayhem will be created if a person is able to run a full-fledged Nmap Scan on a website without leaving any Trace of his IP.</li>
</ul>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
    <li>Since the entire scanning service is provided online on website, user does not have to install anything even remotely related to Nmap. So there will be no trace or finger print of Nmap being ever used or installed on attacker's machine.</li>
</ul>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
    <li>Though the service may claim to be recording the user's IP address but any wise attacker will use a Proxy to access the website providing this service as it will not affect the scanning speed anyways as the scanner would run from site's server.</li>
</ul>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
    <li>The Service can be accessed by Botnets. The Bot Master may be using his bots to run the scans from victim’s machines without the victim ever knowing it.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;"> Though this service which is intended to be professional service to secure One’s own Networks It is been widely abused by miscreants and has simply turned into a free scan party for Hackers. Though the concerns are being raised and pressure is building on website to switch off free scans But history has always proven, an Idea can never be killed. Cheers!!!!</p></p>
